1
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,440
The tongue only describes the little pain,

2
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,280
but deep pain remains speechless.

3
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,360
Since I have send you after my mom, I am left speechless, dad.

4
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,920
You wanted this.

5
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,000
I am going, so you can be at peace in heaven.

6
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,640
I packed all my things, to go to Istanbul. To stay quiet.

7
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,800
Aunt? Aunt, I arrived.

8
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,180
Woah!

9
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,420
Oh, Mister Tayyar, you didn't even go to the terminal.

10
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,520
How is she supposed to find our home from all the way back there? She doesn't know the roads, nothing.

11
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,420
We just left her all alone.

12
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,100
Isn't it enough that we opened our doors for her, so she isn't alone?

13
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,980
Don't expect me to throw a welcome party for someone I had to invite in.

14
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,620
She should have come with us after the funeral.

15
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,540
Tayyar, she has waited for her father's seventh day (turkish tradition, mourning of the dead). What was she supposed to do?

16
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,900
Listen, she only has us.

17
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,120
It won't work this loveless.

18
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,540
Listen, don't spoil that daddy's girl.

19
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,420
Don't place someone else's daughter over our heads on the first day.

20
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,260
Oh my, Tayyar, calling her someone else's daugher and stuff...

21
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,940
She is my niece.

22
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,720
Don't start with that niece -crap!

23
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,480
Shame on you...

24
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,580
Are you talking back to me?

25
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,020
Are <i>you</i> talking back to <i>me</i>?

26
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,340
I will kill you.

27
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,820
-I am gonna kill you. -Mister Tayyar.

28
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
I accidently hit the bowl with my hand, Mrs Aytul...

29
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,800
I am gonna clean it up immediately.

30
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,060
Make Mr Yigit's Car ready, Mister Tayyar.

31
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,540
Will do it now, Mrs Aytul!

32
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,300
Listen to me.

33
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,700
You won't spoil that ---!

34
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,620
She will be thank full that we opened our doors and sit here and be quiet, get it?

35
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,080
Kozan- To Kozan's Farm, is it still far?

36
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,720
We passed it 2 km before, Miss.

37
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,640
Why don't you tell me? Stop, I also want to get off here.

38
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,580
Her father died, she is left alone. Why is he so full of hate, I don't understand.

39
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,580
He calls her 'someone else's daughter'.

40
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,380
She is trusted to me by my brother.

41
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,740
If I don't look after her, who else will?

42
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,760
Honey, I am cleaning up the table, you already had breakfast, right?

43
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,720
I did, I did.

44
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,240
Elmas, don't be like your father.

45
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,100
Don't make your uncle's daughter feel like a stranger, ok?

46
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,300
Yes, mom, spare me with this in the morning.

47
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,720
Look, today I have a very important meeting with Mister Yigit, don't hold me up.

48
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,040
I have to organize some files anyway.

49
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,860
Mister Yigit is driving really fast.

50
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,660
I am afraid something might happen.

51
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,420
That's his hobby.

52
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,620
What is this?

53
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,220
Bro, are we dreaming?

54
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,860
An angel without wings in the middle of the forest.

55
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,240
Hey!

56
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,240
Are you lost?

57
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,640
Did you swallow your tongue?

58
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,740
Let us drop you off.

59
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,600
Or did you not like us?

60
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,140
Get lost!

61
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,780
Bro, this one is really angry.

62
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,040
I said get lost already!

63
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
What if we don't?

64
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,960
Keep driving!

65
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,160
Come back, girl, don't be scared.

66
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,840
My beautiful, where are you going?

67
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,100
-Help! -Run! Run! Run!

68
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,100
Someone help me!

69
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,420
Help!

70
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,520
Don't come any closer!

71
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,960
Oh, now we are really scared.

72
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,420
Come on! Stop being so troublesome! Or worse could happen to you.

73
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,100
-I said don't come closer! -What's going on here?

74
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,320
None of your business.

75
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,320
That's brother Yigit.

76
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,720
They are running away! Do something!

77
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,760
Call the police! I am gonna report them!

78
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,960
Oh, I get it! Being a hero ends here for you!

79
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,500
They should just run away!

80
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,120
Where did I end up here?! What kind of people are you?!

81
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,800
Is this how you thank someone?

82
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,580
You want me to thank you for the ploy you just pulled with your friends?!

83
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,960
My friends?

84
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,480
You are kinda paranoid, aren't you?

85
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,920
Paranoid? Is that so?

86
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,520
I've been attacked by some bandits just two minutes ago.

87
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,960
Now the leader of the bandits let them escape.

88
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
But I am paranoid, right?

89
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Leader of the bandits?

90
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,080
Are these bandits supposed to be my friends?

91
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,860
I thought I was helping you.

92
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,520
Well, you people from Istanbul are known to be helpful, truly.

93
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,600
You, whereever you are from, have a really friendly way of speaking.

94
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,040
-Are you okay? -Don't come closer!

95
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,040
Do whatever you want then.

96
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,460
It's obvious that you are lost. Where do you want to go?

97
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,840
None of your business.

98
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,520
I am trying to help you.

99
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,160
I don't want help.

100
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,420
Don't be stubborn.

101
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Listen, you are in the forest-

102
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,660
Don't come closer!

103
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,480
-God, give me patience.

104
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,200
I said don't come closer!

105
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,240
Listen, no car, no cab will pass this road.

106
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,840
You won't find anything here.

107
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,580
There are some restaurants a few kilometres ahead.

108
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,040
If you are lucky you might find a few grillhouses in the morning.

109
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,440
Can't you ever be quiet?

110
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Can't you ever listen?

111
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,060
Look, I am asking for the last time. Where are you going?

112
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,860
To the god damn Kozan's Farm, ok?!

113
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,080
You are going in the wrong direction.

114
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Did someone ask you for the way?

115
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,740
Stop arguing.

116
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,480
Jump in, let me drive you.

117
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,880
What's your problem?

118
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
What do you want from me?

119
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,280
I don't want any help.

120
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,820
You won't find the house like this. Jump in.

121
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,560
Are you crazy? Are you dumb?

122
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Did someone want your help?

123
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,600
Come here.

124
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,780
What are you doing? You maniac! What are you doing?!

125
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
Help me!

126
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,300
Stop the car!

127
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,200
Someone help me!

128
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,500
We are going to the god damn Kozan's Farm.

129
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
You psychopath!

130
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,740
I want to get off! Let me go!

131
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,860
Are you sick? Why don't you let me go?

132
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,520
Enjoy your meal.

133
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,720
Anything else, Mrs Aytul?

134
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,880
No, thank you.

135
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,660
I did already prepare the ground beef for the young man. Should I make cook dumplings or meat balls for lunch?

136
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,900
He keeps saying meat balls all morning.

137
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,100
You make him meat balls, he can eat dumplings with us to dinner.

138
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,820
Ok.

139
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,400
Where are we here?!

140
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
What's going on Hafize?

141
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,060
It's Mister Yigit's Car.

142
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,060
And someone is with him.

143
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,900
Where are we? Are you crazy? Say something!

144
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,340
My god, Nur!

145
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,860
Hafize, what's going on?

146
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,880
Slow down!

147
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,640
Are you crazy, or what?!

148
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,540
Woah! What are you doing?! I am gonna report you!

149
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,720
You kidnapped me to the top of the mountain!

150
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,820
Aunt?

151
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,540
Elmas?

152
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,240
Welcome to the god damn Kozan Farm.

153
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,520
-My child, how did you come here? -Welcome.

154
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,080
-Yigit, what's going on? -Nothing, Aunt.

155
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,940
Elmas, your cousin came. You are free for today.

156
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,960
But we had a meeting today, Mister Yigit. I can see Nur in the evening.

157
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,420
Nur.

158
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,180
Ok, you are free.

159
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,660
-Mister Tayyar. -Yes.

160
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
The suitcase of the miss is left on the road.

161
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,500
-Can you get someone to pick it up? -Yes, Mister Yigit. Immediately.

162
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,880
I was freaking out all morning how you would find your way here.

163
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,520
But not in 40 years would I have guessed that you would come in Mister Yigit's Car.

164
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,160
Aunt.

165
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,940
Is this man, the Yigit Kozan you would always talk about?

166
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
He is like a thug.

167
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,900
ssshh, keep quiet girl!

168
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,200
How can you call him a thug?

169
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,600
Mister Yigit is our boss.

170
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,040
You said every bad thing you could have said to that man.

171
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,800
I didn't say enough.

172
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,800
I don't know how we are gonna look at Mrs Aytul's face ever again after that.

173
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,020
Well, nevermind. Make yourself ready. Let's go thank them.

174
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,220
I didn't even hug you yet.

175
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,140
What did my brother say back then? 'God damn Kozan Farm'?

176
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,900
She got a big mouth.

177
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,120
But she is beautiful, kinda posh. 

178
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,880
After all that timing they are working for us, you did want to do right by taking her in, but...

179
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I hope we won't regret it, Mrs Aytul.

180
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
This is the Kozan Farm.

181
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Everyone knows their place here.

182
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
And those who don't, will learn.

183
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,680
My child, let's not upset Mrs Aytul.

184
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,420
She is the old Madam here. She is also like Yigit's mother, she is also his aunt, she is also his-

185
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,620
And his?

186
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,120
There is no <i>and</i>, you be polite, that's enough. Come on!

187
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,680
Mrs Aytul. That's my niece Nur.

188
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,760
I am sorry. We regret that she came here with all that noise. 

189
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,640
She would like to kiss your hand and apologize. Come on, my child.

190
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,720
No need. Welcome.

191
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,920
Thank you.

192
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,660
Hafize, dress the child appropriately. 

193
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,280
She should not run around with open blouse and chest.

194
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,680
I am sorry, Mrs Aytul.

195
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,800
My button must have fallen off, when I was trying to escape from your nephew.

196
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,120
My child, how can you talk back to Mrs Aytul? Are you trying to get me in trouble?

197
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Let's go in the kitchen.

198
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,900
You are in good mood.

199
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,400
Yes, I am.

200
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,280
But I am late. Gotta go now.

201
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
It's clear that you will be very busy.

202
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,680
Should we wait for you for dinner tonight?

203
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,020
No, no need. I will be coming back late.

204
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,020
Will you be at the company all day? 

205
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,140
Yes.

206
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,400
Maybe if you find the time, I was thinking we could go for a visit.

207
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,520
Where is Mert?

208
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,440
In his room.

209
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,000
He is being punished.

210
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,160
A kid who is in first grade should not make that much trouble.

211
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,580
He had a report for the first half of the year anyway.

212
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,280
He didn't go to school. Now he is really spoiled, that brat.

213
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,560
Every day a new misbehavior.

214
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,640
Don't indulge on him.

215
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,000
Once you do, he doesn't listen at all.

216
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,140
Ok. I will talk to him.

217
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,140
Ok.

218
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,180
Grandma, grandma! I have a surprise for you. Can you come to my room?!

219
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,540
Mert?

220
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,080
Mert!

221
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,340
Look at him. Look at him.

222
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,880
What's going on? What's this noise?

223
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Oh no, dad. You were here also?

224
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,920
Yeah, I am also here. What's going on?

225
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
What else could it be? Our mister here did lay a trap again.

226
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,080
I see. My child, are you not sick of getting punished by your Grandma?

227
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I swear, I am sick of it, but you aren't.

228
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,900
-I am sick of it, but... -But?

229
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,440
You are sick, but you keep doing it Come here.

230
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,620
My child, be well behaved. 

231
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,540
I am getting angry.

232
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,260
I am not doing it for you guys to get angry.

233
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
I am doing it, so my mom gets angry.

234
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,820
If she sees me misbehave, maybe she will come to scold me.

235
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,180
Why did you say that now?

236
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,220
Look at me.

237
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,200
No more messing around. You will be well behaved. 

238
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,200
And don't say stuff like that.

239
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
Man's word?

240
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,020
-A man's word. -Ok.

241
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,840
Wait!

242
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,340
You didn't take your picture.

243
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,200
You are the tall one.

244
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,480
The angel is my mom.

245
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
She has huge wings.

246
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,300
She swung both of them and came back to us.

247
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,440
You gave a man's word. Don't forget that.

248
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,240
There is a pond, do you see it?

249
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,580
And...

250
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,920
back there are the barns.

251
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,120
We are just missing sheeps and cows, you understand.

252
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,280
It's beautiful.

253
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,080
It's like back at our place. My dad would love it, if he could see it.

254
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,880
Yeah. It's really like back there.

255
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,560
Istanbul, but outside of the inner city life.

256
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,920
Well, weekend comes and we can take you to real Istanbul.

257
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,820
If you lock yourself in this Farm like my parents,

258
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,300
you can't say 'I am living in Istanbul'.

259
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,820
You are bored.

260
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,720
Well, if Mister Yigit wasn't here, I would die of boredom. 

261
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,040
I am working with him, as you know.

262
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
At Kozan's.

263
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,040
In a big plaza.

264
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,000
In the Levent district. In the middle of civilization!

265
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,180
I will drive.

266
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,140
What a rude man.

267
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,620
He must be in a bad mood.

268
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,160
I feel sorry for you. It must be hard working for him.

269
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,460
I can't say Mister Yigit is the easiest man to be around.

270
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,460
But he is my biggest chance.

271
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,600
My only chance is to work with Mister Yigit.

272
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,060
He is very different.

273
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,560
He seems like a smug rich person.

274
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,260
Don't think of him as one of the rich born lucky people.

275
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,260
He build his own luck.

276
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,520
One by one.

277
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,880
Slowly, all by his own, did he climb the latter to wealth.

278
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,560
He didn't count on anyone.

279
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,360
He came to Istanbul without his parents.

280
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,780
Who knows? Maybe the wealth he owns now is nothing compared to the hard work he put in.

281
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,780
Mister Yigit is a big man.

282
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,220
A very big man.

283
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,280
When someone gets as big as him, one gets tougher.

284
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,920
His inside is different. His outside is different.

285
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Tough. Stiff.

286
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,520
And even as you said sometimes rude.

287
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,980
But his inside is very different. He is very different next to his son.

288
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,420
He has a son?

289
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,220
May god give his wife strength.

290
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,400
Is his wife the woman with the curly hair?

291
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,600
No way. That witch is- You know his brother Mister Cahit.

292
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
She is his wife.

293
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,080
My child, stop with the gossip.

294
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,900
Darling, Nur. You must be tired from the trip. Take a bath and relax.

295
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,980
Since you are free today, dress yourself and come help me.

296
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
Aunt, I can help you.

297
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,240
No, my child, you are tired from traveling.

298
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,960
Well then.

299
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,520
Listen, what did you talk about?

300
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,280
Mister Yigit here, Mister Yigit there. 

301
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,000
Girl, don't tell me you did say anything to her?

302
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,380
My god, mother, calm down for once.

303
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,960
I didn't say anything.

304
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,720
Ah, my girl, don't get us in trouble.

305
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,760
If Mister Yigit finds out, we will be thrown out.

306
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,160
You don't say?

307
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,020
Because I couldn't learn what to say and what not after all this time.

308
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,920
Also I know better than all of you what Mister Yigit is sensitive about.

309
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Unbelievable. 

310
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,320
Ah, my child, you are tired from traveling. Elmas could have done that.

311
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,640
How can she be tired from morning till evening, Hafize?

312
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,760
Of course she is gonna do something. Is she supposed to lay around all day?

313
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,420
And let her help you in the kitchen tomorrow.

314
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,680
And talk to Mrs Aytul, she shall put you next to her as help.

315
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,580
I can help my aunt any time, uncle.

316
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,040
But you don't have to ask anyone for a job.

317
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,820
I will start searching for a job tomorrow.

318
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,920
You are gonna search for a job?

319
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,800
My child, this is Istanbul. Not Adana.

320
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,160
Over here the bread is not in the lion's mouth, but in his stomach. (turkish saying: it's hard to make a living)

321
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,140
Especially for someone like you, who hasn't seen a college in her life.

322
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,180
Ah, if you think to make money in a different way, then I don't know.

323
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,200
In case you didn't come here to earn money the righteous way.

324
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,260
If you say 'I want to earn my money with my youth and my beauty', then I don't know.

325
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,780
My, my, what kind of things are you saying, Mister Tayyar?

326
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,480
I wanted it to be said once. 

327
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,240
I don't want trouble just because she is beautiful, tall, what not.

328
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,540
Listen, my child. 

329
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,360
If you came here trusting on your beauty, you and I will have a lot of problems.

330
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,600
I don't trust my beauty. I trust my mind, uncle.

331
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
You don't worry.

332
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,160
By the way Nur, what's with your education?

333
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,160
First I will find a job that earns me enough for myself.

334
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,320
Then I will go take the SAT and hopefully get into university.

335
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,260
Hopefully.

336
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,760
You would want to move out in the future.

337
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,200
Right?

338
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,300
That will hopefully happen, too, uncle. I wouldn't want to burden you any longer.

339
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,480
What happened with your high income officer father?

340
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
He turned to sand

341
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,960
and his daughter is now dependent on Tayyar, who he never liked.

342
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,340
Enjoy the meal. I will get some fresh air.

343
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,660
Don't play with your food.

344
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,120
Finish your plate.

345
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,680
I don't want to.

346
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
My dad still isn't home.

347
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,100
He will be hungry again tonight.

348
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,760
He won't be hungry. He is eating outside.

349
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,020
Your dad is working for you.

350
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,400
I do have everything. Why does he keep working?

351
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,220
Why do you have it all, big guy?

352
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,480
Because your dad is working, right?

353
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,180
Can my dad get everything when he works?

354
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,180
Of course!

355
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,000
When he can get everything, why doesn't he get my mom back from heaven?

356
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,200
Come on, little lamb. Since you don't want to eat, go brush your teeth and go to bed, ok?

357
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,300
Come here, little lamb.

358
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,680
When he keeps going like this, it seems like, we won't be able to send him back to school.

359
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,720
Yigit must get another report then.

360
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
What nonsense are you talking, Nazan?

361
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:04,000
You may not want to know it, Mrs Aytul, but your grandson is still waiting for his mom from heaven.

362
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,300
When he keeps talking weird stuff like that, do you think Yigit would dare to send him to elementary school?

363
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,740
God protect us, what if he draws someone's attention?

364
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,900
Or I don't know if someone comes to him and tells him the truth?

365
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,380
Nazan, don't stick your nose into things that are not your business. 

366
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,400
I assume, Yigit doesn't plan to stay all night, right?

367
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,560
Did you talk to him when leaving the office?

368
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,260
I did knock at his door, but he didn't answer.

369
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,720
You didn't get an answer, but opening the door and taking a look, didn't cross your mind, right, Cahit?

370
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,220
Your little brother didn't want you to disturb his peace, didn't he?

371
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,300
I didn't want to disturb him, Nazan.

372
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,160
It's getting cold here at night.

373
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,020
You will get a cold.

374
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
By the way I am Yigit. 

375
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,620
I know your name.(She uses polite form)

376
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,040
Oh, you went from calling me a maniac to talking politely.

377
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,680
I also know your name, but we didn't really get to meet eachother.

378
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,660
I thought we met in the car.

379
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,120
I am Nur.

380
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,640
You should go inside. 

381
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,360
It's cold.

382
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Don't get a cold.

383
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,080
Good night.

384
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,460
And you are supposed to be a big brother? A big brother that can't even go into the room of his little brother, if he doesn't invite him in.

385
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,680
You are the older one, Cahit. And can't even stand tall against your little brother.

386
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,080
Where is Mert? Is he here?

387
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
I just put him to bed.

388
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,720
Aunt, is Mert with you? Is he downstairs?

389
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,520
Girl, you said you put him to bed, where is this kid?

390
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,280
What's going on, Yigit?

391
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,880
Mert isn't in his room, did you see him?

392
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,400
What's going on?

393
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,220
Did he... ?

394
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,200
Cahit, run. Run!

395
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,780
Mom! Mom!

396
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,160
I am here, mom.

397
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,340
Mommy, I am here. I am here.

398
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,120
Come to me.

399
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,440
Come on.

400
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,460
I am here.

401
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,360
I am here, mommy.

402
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,240
Come to me.

403
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,240
Come on.

404
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,960
Mert! Mert!

405
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,500
Mert! Where are you?!

406
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,660
Come on, Yigit, calm down.

407
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,260
Calm down, for what?!

408
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,040
Tayyar! Tayyar!

409
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,500
-I beg you, calm down. -Calm for what?!

410
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,080
You are so many people and can't even keep an eye on one kid!

411
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,300
He didn't do it for so long. I told you so many times, let's lock his door, but you wouldn't listen.

412
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,880
Mert!

413
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,880
Mert? 

414
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,060
How did you get up there?

415
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,220
Don't be scared. I am coming.

416
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
Keep calm.

417
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,800
Mom!

418
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Wait. Don't move.

419
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
I want my mom!

420
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,040
Come here. Come to me.

421
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,000
Mert? Mert!

422
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,580
Brother! Brother, come here!

423
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,480
Where is he?

424
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,900
Mert! What are you doing there?!

425
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,900
Don't let my dad come here.

426
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,780
He will bring me down.

427
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,140
Stop! Stop, his dad!

428
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,440
We are going down now.

429
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,920
I am coming! Don't move!

430
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,780
I am not even scared!

431
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,080
My mom is gonna come now!

432
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,700
I am not scared!

433
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
Don't move! I am on my way!

434
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,020
Come on, Mert. Give me your hand.

435
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,560
Let's go back.

436
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,020
I won't! I am gonna hold my mom's hand!

437
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,200
Let's go.

438
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,620
Mert!

439
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,120
Ok.

440
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,320
Ok.

441
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,380
Ok.

442
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,480
Let's go. Come on.

443
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,580
-Hug me tight now. -Mert!

444
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,240
Come here!

445
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Wait, his dad. Wait, we are coming down.

446
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,060
Give him to me.

447
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,040
Come here.

448
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Come here, come.

449
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,700
What do you think you are doing?!

450
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,460
What do you think you are doing?!!

451
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,980
You won't do anything like this ever again! Do you understand!?

452
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,960
You won't!

453
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,340
I will! I will! I am gonna do it, till my mom comes back!

454
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
Your mom won't come back, do you understand?!

455
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,340
Your mom won't come!

456
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,540
You liar! My mom is gonna come back!

457
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,160
You said it yourself!

458
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,220
From the clouds, from the stars, from heaven, she will come back!

459
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,480
-Your mom won't come back! -That's enough!

460
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,240
Don't scream at the child!

461
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,200
Give me my grandson.

462
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,420
Come here my boy.

463
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,360
He will not come out of his room!

464
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,380
Did you hear me?! He will not come out of his room!

465
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,400
Yigit, calm dow-

466
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Brother, please! Please.

467
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,960
Why is this here?! Huh?!

468
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,400
Who brought this here?!

469
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
We wanted to cut the branches. We must have forgotten-

470
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,660
Don't start with your branches!

471
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,220
-Bring me the saw! Now! -Yes, Sir!

472
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,220
Nur. Nur.

473
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,520
I am coming, aunt. I just want to catch my breath.

474
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,020
He missed his mom a lot.

475
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,200
Try to be a little understanding.

476
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,620
Tayyar!

477
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,280
Where is the saw?!

478
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,740
I am coming, Sir.

479
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,060
Here you go.

480
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,660
What are you doing? Have you gone crazy?

481
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,600
Out of my way.

482
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
You punished your son already

483
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
now you want to punish the tree, too?

484
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,940
I said, out of my way. It's none of your business.

485
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,420
If you do something like that, is your fear gonna vanish?

486
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,040
You locked him into his room.

487
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,900
What happened? Is your fear gone?

488
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,420
You are scared! A lot!

489
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,180
As long as you keep punishing your son,

490
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,520
instead of understanding him, you will always be scared.

491
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,960
I don't like my dad.

492
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,220
I don't.

493
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,540
Why does he say that my mom won't come?

494
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,320
Heaven was going to give my mom back.

495
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,700
Why is my mom not coming? Why?

496
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,560
I feel like I am going to dream of that child tonight.

497
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,020
How he was reaching out to the stars calling for his mother.

498
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,020
It's clear in front of my eyes.

499
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,020
What happened to his mom?

500
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,200
A car accident.

501
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,280
Three years ago.

502
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,060
He really misses his mom.

503
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,460
Like he has not accepted her death.

504
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,860
He thinks she is going to come back.

505
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,480
It's sad.

506
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,480
Very sad.

507
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,700
Why don't you understand, Iclal? Why?

508
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,060
It doesn't work and it won't work.

509
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,780
You know exactly how it all started.

510
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
It was wrong from the very beginning.

511
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,080
You know that my aunt did plan all this.

512
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,740
It was all wrong from the very beginning, Iclal.

513
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,400
I love you, Yigit.

514
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,120
Iclal.

515
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,500
You do love me? Then why is life a living hell for us?

516
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,220
Why are we waking up and fighting? Why are we arguing every day?

517
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,240
Look, Iclal. 

518
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,760
I want to divorce you.

519
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,940
Do you understand? I want to divorce you.

520
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,100
You want to divorce me, huh?

521
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,060
Yes.

522
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,740
-You want to have a life without me? -Yes!

523
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,220
But for me there is no life without you, Yigit.

524
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,540
If you are not here, then there is no life here!

525
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,340
Iclal, what are you doing?!

526
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,120
-Let go! -Stop!

527
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,100
Ms Iclal might open her eyes now or after many years. 

528
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,360
Or even never wake up.

529
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,620
Three years! You say that for 3 years!

530
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,080
When will the mother of my child wake up?!

531
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,240
When?! 

532
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Time is ticking.

533
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,120
Your wife might never wake up.

534
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,600
We all get wounded with time. Small, big.

535
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Small, big.

536
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,380
Deep.

537
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,160
We all have many small wounds here and there.

538
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,160
Time...

539
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,700
helps close some wounds.

540
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,700
Some you can't even see, or even feel.

541
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,680
But some, even when they are only scars, never stop bleeding.

542
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,840
Time... doesn't heal every wound.

543
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,180
They may be hidden from the eyes. But the heart feels them.

544
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,400
Yigit Kozan.

545
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,980
A proud, rude, cruel man.

546
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,300
But seems like you are also deeply wounded, like I am.

547
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,600
Dad! Dad! A balloon tree!

548
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
For you, my son!

549
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
A balloon tree!

550
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,320
Mert! Your feet are naked, Mert.

551
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,720
Dad!

552
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,540
Dad!

553
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,520
Are you running around with bare feet?

554
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,140
You are gonna catch a cold.

555
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,200
Be careful not to step on something sharp. Come.

556
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,200
Good boy!

557
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,240
Did you do that for me, dad?

558
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,620
Of course, for you!

559
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,520
Come up.

560
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,980
Won't you be mad?

561
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,980
Why should I be mad, my son? Come on.

562
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,560
You were angry last night.

563
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,240
But now I am here.

564
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,980
Come, come, come.

565
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,700
Woop, Superman!
