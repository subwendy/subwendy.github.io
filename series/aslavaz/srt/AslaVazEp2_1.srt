1
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,880
Brother, what have you done?

2
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,360
After my wife has kissed the hand of my aunt,

3
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,280
after that I will talk to you all.

4
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,110
Wife?

5
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,110
What wife?

6
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,890
Did he say 'my wife'?

7
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,580
Wif- Shame on you.

8
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,350
Shame on you.

9
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,480
Aunt.

10
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,090
I will talk to all of you.

11
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,480
Be quiet.

12
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,020
You don't have an aunt.

13
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,290
I will never forgive you.

14
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,960
Even if I die here now because of my pain,

15
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
I will not forgive you!

16
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,550
Shame on you.

17
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,080
What is this?

18
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,890
Come, Nur. Let me bring you to the bedroom.

19
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,890
-Aunt. -Shame on you. Shame on you. How can this be?

20
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,600
Shame on you.

21
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,550
Come.

22
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,630
Come, my love. Sit down.

23
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,720
Sit.

24
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,100
It is my fault.

25
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,100
It's all my fault.

26
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,400
First I will go downstairs and talk to them.

27
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,840
Then we'll talk.

28
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,070
There are important things I have to tell you.

29
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,890
Trust me.

30
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,710
Yigit.

31
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,700
I trust you.

32
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,700
Brother, have you gone mad?

33
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,640
I don't understand anything. Aren't you already married?

34
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,070
I can't deal with you, too.

35
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,330
I didn't want it to go down like this.

36
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,380
But what can I do? It's happened.

37
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,850
I didn't see any other way.

38
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,220
-Listen carefully now. I- -You!

39
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,720
You...

40
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,740
You tricked me.

41
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,760
You made me sign a letter of attorney.

42
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,780
You tricked me and divorced your wife.

43
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,580
You divorced my daughter by using my signature!

44
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,840
Shame on you.

45
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,650
Shame on you!

46
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,670
I wasn't just your aunt, I was like your mother!

47
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,880
I was like your father!

48
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,400
And what did you do?

49
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,190
You divorced my daughter.

50
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,080
In addition you married your servant's niece

51
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
who was a beggar just yesterday.

52
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,700
Shame on you.

53
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,310
Shame on you!

54
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,310
What else can I say to you?

55
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,960
Shame on you.

56
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,770
Could I have any more words left for you?

57
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,890
What else is left there to say other than 'shame on you' now?

58
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,640
Are you insane, Brother? Are you insane? What are you doing?!

59
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,900
I bet he didn't even make her sign a prenup.

60
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,190
Yigit, for the love of God, what have you done?

61
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,630
Enough!

62
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,630
I've fallen in love!

63
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,180
I have fallen in love!

64
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,940
I loved her, I married her!

65
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,860
Nur is my wife.

66
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,800
My wife!

67
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,400
You can be shocked!

68
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,400
You can be angry! You can beat me up!

69
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,890
Do what you want!

70
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,900
But you will accept that!

71
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,300
Nur is my wife.

72
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,940
Mr Yigit?

73
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,610
Hello Mr Yigit, can you hear me?

74
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,740
Good news! Your wife has woken up.

75
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,700
Mr Yigit, do you hear me?

76
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
I am saying your wife has woken up!

77
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,150
Mr Yigit, congratulations.

78
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,360
Hello, Mr Yigit?

79
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,880
Hello? Hello, can you hear me?

80
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,200
Mr Yigit?

81
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,910
Aunt.

82
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,420
You are like my mother to me.

83
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,190
I never forgot the work you have put into me, nor my son- not even a day.

84
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,320
I tricked you.

85
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,970
I did.

86
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,290
I divorced your daughter by tricking you.

87
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,430
You wouldn't have understood. You wouldn't have listened.

88
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,120
I wronged you, Aunt.

89
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,390
I wronged you.

90
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,110
But this wrong I did to you and your daughter

91
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,170
I did on the day I married your daughter without loving her.

92
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,780
You put my girl in the ground before she died.

93
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,350
Nur?

94
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,810
Schlange.

95
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,970
You sneaky snake.

96
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,350
-You are a snake. -Aunt.

97
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,630
A phone call for you.

98
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,670
-Now is not the time. Please call again later. -Mr Yigit! Congratulations!

99
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,160
Your wife woke up.

100
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,790
Mr Yigit? Can you hear me?

101
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,040
I am saying your wife has woken up.

102
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,470
Hello, Mr Yigit?

103
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,480
Hello?

104
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Hello, can you hear me?

105
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,480
Mr Yigit?

106
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,460
What is happening, Yigit?

107
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,680
Brother, what is happening? Speak already.

108
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,960
Yigit, speak! What is going on?

109
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,050
Iclal...

110
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,660
Iclal?

111
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,980
Did she die, Yigit?

112
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,800
Iclal woke up.

113
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,400
She is out of the coma.

114
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,920
She woke up...

115
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,720
She woke up.

116
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,640
Aunt! Aunt.

117
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,510
Aunt.

118
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,190
She came out of the coma.

119
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,740
You...

120
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,320
You lied to me.

121
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,720
You said your wife died.

122
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,940
You said she's dead.

123
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,380
Nur. Don't leave.

124
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,720
Don't touch.

125
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,980
Don't touch me.

126
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,430
My daughter...

127
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,840
-Bring me to my daughter.  -Ok.

128
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,700
-Cahit, bring me to my daughter. -Ok, Aunt.

129
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
I will get the car immediately.

130
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,730
My daughter...

131
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,730
What are you still doing here?

132
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,490
Have you not heard, your wife has woken up?

133
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,490
Your wife has woken up.

134
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,870
The one, who you divorced with trickery and lies just yesterday,

135
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,510
the mother of your child, has woken up.

136
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,130
What are you doing?

137
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,420
What are you going to do?

138
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,070
Are you not coming with us?

139
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,130
Say what you are going to do?!

140
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,700
-Are you going to have your wedding night with her?! What are you going to do?! -Aunt!

141
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,400
Come on, let's go. The car is ready.

142
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,940
Nazan, you stay here and have an eye on Mert, ok?

143
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,220
Sure. Sure.

144
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,220
You lied to me.

145
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,460
I wanted to tell you everything, Nur.

146
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,210
I swear to you, I wanted to tell you everything.

147
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,510
You lied to me.

148
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,770
No.

149
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,770
I didn't lie to you.

150
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,770
I hid the truth, yes.

151
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,610
But I didn't lie, Nur.

152
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,400
I didn't lie.

153
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,590
Yigit.

154
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,850
I can't stall our Aunt any longer. Let's go please.

155
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,450
Wait here for me.

156
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,180
I beg you, please wait here for me.

157
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,090
Dad, why are you being so loud?

158
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,090
You woke me up.

159
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,980
Where are you going?

160
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,490
Come, Mert. Your dad has stuff to do. I will put you back to bed.

161
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,190
Nur can bring me to bed.

162
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,450
Nur, come one. Bring me to bed.

163
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,530
My, what a sly one she is.

164
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,160
Still in her wedding dress, but she took the kid by his hand and did go anyways.

165
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,160
You listen to me!

166
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,900
You will leave them alone.

167
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,220
You won't say one word to Mert.

168
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,790
Got it?

169
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,080
Before we know for sure that his mother is alright,

170
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,320
you won't say anything to my son.

171
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,020
Got it?!

172
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,990
You look just like the fairy out of the stories my aunt told me.

173
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,680
Where you also scared of Aunt Nazan?

174
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,640
Come now. Fall asleep.

175
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,980
Don't be scared. I will protect you.

176
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,480
Can you tell me a bed time story?

177
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,040
Thank god, I am reunited with my son again.

178
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,230
Sweet home.

179
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,830
I really missed it!

180
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,760
And your mother missed you, my dear.

181
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,050
Come on, Hafize, come on.

182
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,460
Because his bus was stuck in traffic, I am starving.

183
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,380
Hurry up, Hafize.

184
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,520
I am saying I am starving and you still blabber.

185
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Nur probably has made dinner alrea-

186
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,820
Yeah... She did.

187
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,030
God knows, on what fun trip the young Lady is today.

188
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,680
There is no way.

189
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,210
She probably just took a nap. Go, Elmas, wake her up.

190
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,280
Ok.

191
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,050
And you, my dear, can take a nice bath.

192
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,800
Dinner should be ready by the time you are out.

193
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,750
Alright? My big lion.

194
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,290
Nur isn't here.

195
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,600
What?

196
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,210
Mrs Iclal?

197
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,460
Can you hear me?

198
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,310
Your finger. You only have to move one finger.

199
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,990
Out of my way. I want to see my daughter.

200
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,850
Miss, you can't go in like that, please.

201
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,220
What do you mean by I can't? I am going to see my daughter!

202
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,510
The doctor is going to meet you in his office first. Please don't cause any trouble.

203
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,250
-Doctor, I want to see my daughter. -Please calm down. You will see Miss Iclal soon.

204
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,920
But first we need to talk.

205
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,050
My friend is doing the last tests.

206
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,410
Please follow me.

207
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,840
Please follow me.

208
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,870
Mr Yigit?

209
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,240
Hello Mr Yigit? Can you hear me?

210
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,960
Good news.

211
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,470
Your wife woke up.

212
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,460
I wanted to tell you everything, Nur. I swear I wanted to tell you everything.

213
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,700
I did hide the truth, yes.

214
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
But I didn't lie, Nur.

215
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,440
Wait here for me.

216
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,400
Please I beg you, wait for me.

217
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,500
My beautiful daughter.

218
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,500
Welcome back, my daughter.

219
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,870
Good morning, my dear.

220
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,270
Good morning, my daughter.

221
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,270
My sweet girl.

222
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,180
Doesn't she see me? Why doesn't she look me in my face?

223
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,420
It's too early to expect our patient to react normal to her environment.

224
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,600
We know she is aware of us for now.

225
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,270
That is enough for us.

226
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,310
Please don't tire her too much.

227
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,170
I am going to the laboratory and will be right back.

228
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,400
My lovely child.

229
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,480
My beautiful daughter.

230
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,480
Tell me.

231
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,480
Tell me, my dear.

232
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,770
What do you want from your mother, tell me, my dear.

233
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,220
Yigit.

234
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,950
Your wife...

235
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,360
is asking for you.

236
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,230
Yigit.

237
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,300
Iclal.

238
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,580
Welcome back.

239
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,270
Let's not tire our patient any longer please.

240
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,740
We have to start with the tests. You can wait outside.

241
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,810
Are you still here, knock-off bride?

242
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,040
Some only dream of things, that others are destined to.[proverb]

243
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,730
The wedding night turned to the night of painful tears.

244
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,710
You know I had a bad feeling about you, the first time I saw you.

245
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,790
I saw your hungry eyes lust after everything here, but

246
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,400
even I couldn't imagine this much, to be honest.

247
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,710
I don't know if you are a witch or a healer, but you can sweet talk yourself into anything.

248
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,720
But your luck has run dry.

249
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,690
I mean, the sleeping beauty who was asleep like a baby,

250
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,430
wakes up out of nowhere on your wedding night.

251
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,730
Well, even a good player gets a bad hand sometimes.

252
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,870
I didn't know that Mert's mother is alive.

253
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,050
Your aunt and uncle really have a tight mouth. Impressive.

254
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,840
Good job, from them. They really are worth every penny.

255
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,040
Well, since you know everything now, why are you still here?

256
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,090
Are you waiting to spend your wedding night with a husband who went to his hidden wife?

257
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,880
I came here believing in Yigit's words

258
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,620
and looking into his eyes.

259
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,880
Don't worry.

260
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,280
He will say what he has to say

261
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,730
and I will leave while looking into the same eyes again.

262
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,980
How is my daughter, Doctor?

263
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,630
We have to be very very careful in this early stage.

264
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,280
The transition from coma to a normal life is a risky period and demands small cautious steps.

265
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,670
The tests we are running will take a few days.

266
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,920
-We will inform you in the following days. -Inform us?

267
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,230
I will be here anyways, I am not going anywhere.

268
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,880
Mrs Aytul, I told you already it won't help you nor your daughter to be staying here.

269
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,540
We have to let her rest.

270
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,160
The following days are crucial.

271
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,550
You have to rest and be strong, too.

272
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,360
When will we have the results of the tests?

273
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
We will tell you before noon.

274
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,470
-I wish you a nice morning. -Thank you.

275
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,320
Brother, what's going on?

276
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,820
I will tell you on the ride home. We are leaving.

277
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,060
You heard the doctor, Aunt.

278
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,530
It doesn't do any good to stay here. Come on.

279
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,320
Let's rest for a few hours and come back with Mert in the afternoon.

280
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,510
-We won't tell Mert anything, Aunt. -Why not?

281
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,420
My daughter will be reunited with her child.

282
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
You heard the doctor, Aunt.

283
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,860
I can't play with my son's feelings before knowing for sure how Iclal's situation is.

284
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,100
If I'm going to tell him 'Your mom is healthy again. She is coming back.'

285
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,890
I must be sure it's true.

286
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,130
I can't tell him that while being afraid.

287
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,320
You are not afraid of my daughter's death,

288
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,120
you are afraid that she might live.

289
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,380
I will pretend I didn't hear that, Aunt.

290
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,380
Because I have to look you in the eyes.

291
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,660
If you have a heart, turn around and look me in the eyes.

292
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
Look at me!

293
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,530
You were driving the car that fateful night.

294
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,130
3 years...

295
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,000
Exactly for 3 years

296
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
day and night

297
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,220
I was in pain every single day.

298
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,740
And even then I didn't blame you. I didn't say it's your fault.

299
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,230
But now I am clinging to your collar and I am begging you.

300
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,650
As your substitute mother.

301
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,480
As a mother, I am begging you.

302
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,230
You started this fire.

303
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,470
Now put it out.

304
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,330
Nur.

305
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,630
Marry me.

306
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,460
Nur!

307
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,930
Where is she?

308
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,720
Now I am done for. I am done for.

309
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,030
I am done for. Where is this girl again?

310
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,330
Mrs Aytul! Mrs Aytul!

311
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,720
I beg you, please help me.

312
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,370
What's going on so early in the morning?

313
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,760
Nur! Nur is missing.

314
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,220
I fell asleep yesterday and now she is nowhere to be found.

315
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,810
I was thinking of going to the police. Maybe by car- No, maybe we should call a taxi.

316
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,670
If I tell Tayer, he will kill me and not let me go anywhere.

317
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,840
You don't need to go anywhere. Your niece isn't missing.

318
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,160
No...

319
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,650
How can that be? It can't be.

320
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,650
My niece wouldn't do something like that.

321
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,650
I don't know what can or cannot be.

322
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,440
But what I tell you is the truth.

323
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,090
Your niece did go back to Adana.

324
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,640
She came to me, told me she doesn't want to stay here with you any longer.

325
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,250
No way.

326
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,250
There is no way that can be.

327
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,390
All her things are still in her room. How can someone leave without a suitcase or anything?

328
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,020
Behave yourself, Hafize!

329
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,820
Are you questioning me?!

330
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,820
No, how could I?

331
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,070
I have dealt enough with your family problems.

332
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,070
If I say your niece left, she left.

333
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,730
And you are free for a few days.

334
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,410
Don't come into the house without being called.

335
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,140
Aunt!

336
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,610
Why did you do that?

337
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,240
Why did you lie?

338
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,470
She literally is my brother's wife. She is at home.

339
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,000
Whatever I told Hafize is true.

340
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,120
I will give money into that girl's pocket and she will leave.

341
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,210
This wedding will be over.

342
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,390
And no one will know of this disgrace.

343
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,970
I waited for you.

344
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,090
Not because you wanted me to. Because I wanted to.

345
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,240
Because I wanted to ask you one question.

346
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,550
Why?

347
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,680
Why did you do this to me?

348
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,290
Why?!

349
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,970
Why did you trick me?!

350
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,970
Why?!

351
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,520
What will happen now, Aunt?

352
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,990
What if she doesn't want to go back to Adana?! What if our lie gets exposed?

353
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,460
Cahit is showering. I told him to sleep, but...

354
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,860
I couldn't get an ounce of sleep last night.

355
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,550
I get goosebumps whenever I think of it.

356
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,690
It's unbelievable.

357
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,720
Exactly 3 years and she woke up at the day of her husband's wedd-

358
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,030
Nazan!

359
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,530
You can say what you want, Mrs Aytul.

360
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,060
It's like Iclal figured out what happened to her and woke up immediately.

361
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,980
What happened?

362
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,760
I am dying of curiosity.

363
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,590
Did she say or ask something?

364
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,160
Is this girl upstairs?

365
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,420
Of course.

366
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,910
In fact I think Yigit also went upstairs a moment ago.

367
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,190
What ever they are doing...

368
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,570
She is very obedient.

369
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,020
She waited for her husband at the window all night.

370
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,670
Listen to yourself!

371
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,940
This marriage has no meaning.

372
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,520
Don't ever forget this.

373
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,520
No one should.

374
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,820
You have to tell this to the girl now, Mrs Aytul.

375
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,860
She didn't even take off her wedding dress.

376
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,480
I don't think this girl is one to easily get rid off.

377
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
You heard it from me first.

378
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,000
I ask for your son's mother's grave.

379
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,780
I tried to share your pain like an idiot.

380
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,110
I tried to understand you.

381
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,710
And you! What did you do?!

382
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,710
You tricked me!

383
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,480
While you said you love me,

384
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
While you held my hand,

385
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,850
while I said that I am in love with you,

386
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,300
you were married! Married!

387
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,350
While I loved you, she was asleep.

388
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,730
Say something, you monster!

389
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,520
When did you want to tell me?! When?!

390
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,040
I was scared.

391
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,500
I was afraid I might lose you.

392
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,790
You lost me.

393
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,350
The day we united was the day you lost me.

394
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,370
The day we have waited for years has arrived.

395
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,370
A miracle has happened.

396
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,420
But I... can't even look my daughter in the eyes.

397
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,030
I couldn't even tell my son the good news.

398
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,170
Oh, right, we forgot about Sinan.

399
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,430
What's the time in america right now?

400
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,740
Mr Yigit must put out this fire.

401
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,620
I will call Sinan after the situation has cooled down.

402
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,740
Aunt.

403
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,440
You should rest up and sleep a bit.

404
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,750
I cannot sleep as long as this ****** is upstairs.

405
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,490
Aunt.

406
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,670
She is a *****, isn't she?

407
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,140
Aunt!

408
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,530
What do you think you are doing?

409
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,530
I am leaving. Don't worry.

410
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,750
We will get divorced immediately.

411
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,750
You won't see me ever again.

412
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,170
Do you think I am stupid?

413
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,720
On you this miserable wedding dress,

414
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,980
you will run to the out-building and cry.

415
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,980
After crying out to your aunt, you will put us in the hands of that sly uncle of yours.

416
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,050
I don't even understand what you are trying to say.

417
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,050
Who do you think you are fooling?

418
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,550
No one is going to see you like this.

419
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,710
Just as you quietly sneaked your way into my nephew's heart,

420
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,690
you will leave this house just as quietly.

421
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,200
If you tell your aunt and uncle just one word,

422
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,960
if you tell anyone about this fake marriage,

423
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,610
I won't let you pay the price, but them.

424
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,040
I won't show any mercy and throw them out of here.

425
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Do you understand?

426
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,580
You are threatening me in vein.

427
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,320
Even if you don't believe me,

428
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,100
I have been just as tricked as you were.

429
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
This is enough humiliation.

430
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,950
-I don't want to share this [humiliation] with my aunt. -Be quiet.

431
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,370
Nazan.

432
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,910
Help this shameless girl change into something else and give her some money.

433
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,160
Without anyone seeing, send her off through the service door.

434
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,620
You will go to Adana.

435
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,220
Your family believe you to be there anyways.

436
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
'Believe me to be there anyways'?

437
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,220
They asked about you in the morning.

438
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,610
And my aunt...

439
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,890
What are you doing?!

440
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,910
Let me go!

441
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,910
Let me go! Don't touch me!

442
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,180
What are you doing?! Let me go!

443
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,350
I said let go!

444
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,350
I am telling you to let go!

445
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,300
Let go!

446
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,570
-Get inside! -Let go! -Get inside!

447
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,340
Sit down! You will listen to me!

448
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,880
Exactly 3 years! For 3 years she was asleep!

449
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,590
For 3 years...

450
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,760
I didn't know what to say to my son.

451
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,360
'You don't have a mother anymore.'

452
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,330
I couldn't say: 'Actually you do and you don't.'

453
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,710
I also couldn't say: 'Wait. She might wake up one day.'

454
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,730
'Don't wait. We need a miracle for her to wake up.'

455
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,780
'Your mother has died.', I couldn't say.

456
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,700
I made up a fairy tale that she will come from heaven.

457
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,630
That fairy tale made him fall asleep at night.

458
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,790
I hid everything.

459
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,610
Everything. I used my power, my money, my all.

460
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,080
I turned Iclal to a secret no one dares to talk about.

461
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,370
I deleted all news, all details about the accident.

462
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,270
I fired everyone who only dared to look like they might question me.

463
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,810
I calculated everything.

464
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,810
I thought of everything.

465
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,900
Just one thing I missed.

466
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,180
You.

467
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,130
Love.

468
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,180
Don't dare talk about love.

469
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,920
Love has died for me, yesterday at this farm.

470
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,920
It has died on the grounds it had been born.

471
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,650
You fooled your son.

472
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,560
You fooled your aunt, who took you in like a mother.

473
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
You fooled me.

474
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,460
You have fooled everyone who loved you.

475
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
What lie do you know of?

476
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,680
You just don't know of all the truths.

477
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,680
I don't want your truth.

478
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,810
I don't even want to see your face.

479
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,810
Go out of my way.

480
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,010
You won't go anywhere!

481
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,920
What are you doing?! What are you doing?!

482
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,880
Are you going to lock me up in this room?!

483
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,630
Yes.

484
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,080
Are you insane?!

485
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,140
Yigit! Are you insane?! Open the door!

486
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,780
I am insane!

487
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,780
With all my heart!

488
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,150
He has lost it.

489
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,360
He locked her up in the room for real.

490
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,510
Why can't I just die?

491
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,750
Aunt.

492
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,970
Please don't move, I can't measure like this.

493
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,500
I think he is coming.

494
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,360
You promised me.

495
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,550
I said 'Put out the fire' and you promised me. What are doing, huh?

496
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,430
What are you doing?! What are you doing?!

497
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,640
I know!

498
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,640
I promised!

499
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,100
I will fix everything for everyone, Aunt.

500
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,570
I will find a wway.

501
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,900
Nur...

502
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
my wife

503
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,560
While my wife is here

504
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,500
While my wife is with me, I will find a way, Aunt.

505
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,500
Yaren.

506
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,620
Go out with Mert when he is awake.

507
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,430
Go to the cinema, do whatever you want.

508
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,430
Just keep him away from the house.

509
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,110
You take Elmas and go to the company.

510
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,110
Cancel every meeting.

511
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,660
-Yigit, can we-  -Later.

512
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,660
Later.

513
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,140
Nazan, go bring me Hafize.

514
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,240
She is probably worried by now, I have to tell her everything.

515
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,590
Here?

516
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,970
Here!

517
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,170
Hurry up!

518
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,710
Sister-in-law!

519
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,830
We can't do that, Brother.

520
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,210
We told [politely called]Aunt Hafize that Nur has gona back to Adana.

521
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,310
You did what?!

522
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,780
Another lie?!

523
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,190
Yigit.

524
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,040
This way...

525
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,080
things will stay calmer.

526
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,790
Mom, please stop crying.

527
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,610
Nur will call us for sure.

528
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:22,540
Maybe she felt overwhelmed or maybe she went to water the graves of her parents.

529
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,540
And would she leave without seeing me?

530
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,050
She left, son.

531
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,830
Without even saying good bye to her aunt, she just left.

532
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:35,080
Hadn't Mrs Aytul herself told me, I would have never believed it.

533
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,830
So she is someone who can just leave like that.

534
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,770
My... Mom, Emin is right.

535
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,510
She probably just needed a break.

536
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,770
If she told you, you would have made a big deal out of it.

537
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,990
Seems like she wanted some time to think

538
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,320
and went to Adana.

539
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,020
She will call, don't worry.

540
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,390
If she doesn't, we can call her.

541
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,470
What was the name of their neighbors? The ones with the daughter.

542
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,840
We can ask them.

543
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,360
Don't you worry.

544
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,060
Only bad things come to my mind.

545
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,700
What if that maniac found her?

546
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,630
What maniac?

547
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,540
Don't you remember that one troublemaker, that psycho? She's talking about him.

548
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,560
No, I can't just sit here.

549
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,280
Hafize.

550
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,920
If your hand reaches that phone for that shameless girl,

551
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,730
I will bring your hands, one by one. Just so you know.

552
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,860
What?

553
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,070
Don't you like the way I talk to your mom?

554
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,380
Mother's son.

555
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,170
I will be heading off to work now. See you later.

556
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,380
Have a nice day at work, my child.

557
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,400
Good morning, Mr Cahit.

558
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,580
Good morning.

559
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,830
We'll be going with my car today.

560
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,830
And Mr Yigit?

561
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,980
Yigit won't come to work today.

562
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,580
But he has many meetings today.

563
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,940
Is he sick?

564
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,120
He doesn't feel well.

565
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,570
You have to cancel the meetings.

566
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,180
Let's go.

567
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,400
Cahit, tell me already, what happened?

568
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,550
Elmas, it's personal. Regarding the family.

569
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,030
Please don't pressure me.

570
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,540
Since you came, and he didn't, it's something regarding Mr Yigit.

571
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,030
The only person you care about is Mr Yigit, isn't it?

572
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,030
What does that have to do with anything?

573
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,070
I am his assistant basically.

574
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,070
What do you mean?

575
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,020
How often are you going to be jealous of Mr Yigit, Cahit? We have talked about this many times.

576
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,850
-He isn't someone like this for me. I just-      -...admire him.

577
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,850
That he is so successful.

578
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,830
His power.

579
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,830
You admire the way he carries himself.
