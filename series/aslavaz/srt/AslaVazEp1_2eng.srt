1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,000
Good job.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,240
Did we make up?

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,480
We did.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,020
Listen, son.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,320
Wherever you go from now on

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,680
to the trees, to the clouds, to the sun

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,800
wherever you go, don't ever let go of dad's hand. Got it?

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,080
-Got it. -Good boy.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,800
Let's wave to my mom, dad.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,160
Dad, should we send a balloon to my mom?

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,620
Let's do it.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,860
Here.

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,080
Wait.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,300
Let's count to three and let go together, ok?

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,300
One, two, three.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,220
Balloons, go greet my mom.

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,140
-Good morning, aunt. -Good morning, dear.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,680
Good morning, Elmas.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,960
Good morning.

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,100
What's up? You seem very happy.

21
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,100
The weather outside is beautiful today.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,260
-Come eat breakfast, my dears. -Come on.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,400
Aunt?

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,440
What happened to your face?

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,900
Nothing, my dear.

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,400
Aunt, look at me.

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,340
My uncle is beauting you?!

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,960
Shh! It's alright, Nur. It was just a slap

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,500
My face is very sensible. It leaves a mark right away.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Aunt, it's clear!

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,980
-He is beating you! -Shh. It's ok.

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,980
I am getting late, I won't eat,

33
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,800
I will be leaving right away. Oh, Nur!

34
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,040
This is my company's card. The address is on there.

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
Stop by after you are done searching for a job. We can go home together.

36
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,500
Elmas.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,400
Are you blind?

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Are you deaf? Can't you speak?

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Don't you see the state your mom is in?

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,840
Nur, my dear. Don't make a fuss.

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,660
Your dad is beating your mom!

42
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,120
Can't you see, Elmas?

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,700
I don't. Do you understand, Nur?

44
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
I don't see anything.

45
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,380
You wanna know why?

46
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,920
Because I didn't choose these parents.

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,080
But I did choose the life I wanna live!

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,600
In this life there is no room for this misery.

49
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,940
I don't have time to waste for my father's torments or my mother's wretchedness.

50
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,140
I don't plan to let my mascara run down in a place like this.

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,840
I am going to work.

52
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,660
You really do love balloons, don't you?

53
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,300
Aunt, did you see our balloon tree?

54
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,180
How could I not? I did. What a wonderful surprise of your dad.

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,380
We let balloons fly for my mom together.

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,300
Don't run around bare foot. Come here, let's dress you.

57
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,180
Go on to grandma. Come on. Time to dress.

58
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,700
Handsome.

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,560
So you did ask for forgiveness because of yesterday, didn't you, Yigit?

60
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,060
Though I don't know if you did the right thing.

61
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,920
Now that he is done with the roof, I hope he doesn't make a thing of climbing trees.

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,640
I did talk to my son. We made a deal.

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,480
Where is Cahit? Did he leave already?

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,220
He left early to avoid getting scolded by his boss.

65
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,460
You don't think he left early to get away from his wife?

66
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,700
No?

67
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,420
Don't forget, Nazan.

68
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,680
One thing I can tolerate the least in this world are two-faced people.

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,320
You cannot talk bad behind closed doors.

70
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,240
No one in my house, <i>NO ONE</i>

71
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
can run around wearing masks.

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,880
What did I say just now to Yigit, huh?

73
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,660
I was just messing around. Did I say something bad?

74
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,220
My, he got upset just because I said something regarding his son.

75
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,220
Because deep down he knows himself, that he spoiled him too much.

76
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,300
He is trying to fill the hole his mom left behind, what is he supposed to do?

77
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,940
The hole his mom left?

78
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,900
Please. Someone who hears you might think, that Iclal ever was a mother to that child. What did she ever do?

79
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,340
Her whole purpose was to run after Yigit

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,000
and cry about how her pregnancy ruined her body, and how if she breastfeeds it might get saggy,

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,260
and how her husband distanced herself since she gave birth.

82
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,640
What's up? You got all quiet. Of course, you cannot agree, out of fear of your aunt.

83
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
That aunt, that aunt.

84
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,480
She did ruin your brother with her own daughter basically.

85
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,780
'Aunt', what a joke.

86
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,020
Sister(-in-law)....

87
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,280
Just to keep the wealth in the family, she has thrown her own daughter at her nephew.

88
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,900
But see what has happened? Mrs Iclal couldn't even taste the wealth.

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,260
Please, Yaren. Don't make me talk.

90
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,340
As if Iclal was a mother when she was alive.

91
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,200
When a blind person dies they are remembered with almond eyes. (Proverb: People are seen in a better light after their death)

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,840
My daughter isn't dead, Nazan.

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,260
My Iclal is not dead.

94
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,120
Not dead.

95
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,200
No one did see you, you are sure, right?

96
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,700
That's how sure I am.

97
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,940
Aunt.

98
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,320
You don't have to bear this.

99
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,700
This man can not treat you like this.

100
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
Bring me a tea.

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,660
What kind of man are you?!

102
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,160
-Nur, my child! -Hafize,

103
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,860
What does this rude one talk about?

104
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,860
Look at my aunt's face.

105
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,640
You won't raise your hand ever again, do you understand?!

106
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,520
You won't touch my aunt ever again.

107
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,020
-Are you trying to scold me, you shameless?! -Oh my!

108
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,720
Don't. Don't, uncle.

109
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,940
Tayyar!

110
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,180
I am sorry, Mister Yigit. It's a family matter.

111
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,660
You have seen it yourself.

112
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,040
A bad behaved, rude girl. She is driving one crazy.

113
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,840
What do you think you are doing? What do you think you are doing?!!

114
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,560
You cannot raise your hand against a woman on my land! Do you understand?

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,840
I understand, Mister Yigit.

116
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,400
If I ever see your hand raised like that, you know what I will do, don't you?

117
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,080
-I know. -You know, don't you? -I know.

118
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,580
Leave.

119
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,640
-Yes, Sir. -Leave! I don't want to see you.

120
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,220
Nur.

121
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,220
Wait.

122
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,340
Are you alright?

123
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I was good even before you came.

124
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I did solve my problem myself.

125
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,720
You didn't need to show off like that.

126
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,720
It was not a show off.

127
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,560
I just talked in a language your uncle understands.

128
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
And not for you, but for myself.

129
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,920
By the way, the balloon tree was a good idea.

130
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,100
I could hear the laughs of the little one way back in my room.

131
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,500
Thank you.

132
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,280
For last night.

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,280
And for the balloon tree.

134
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,880
You thank me for the balloon tree?

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,040
Well, you kept that tree alive.

136
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,700
My aunt asked for something from the kitchen, so I should go.

137
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,780
Your little brother did worse than kick me out.

138
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,840
And on top of that, I did get a slap from your aunt at my age.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,680
Nazan.

140
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,800
It's okay. Please calm down. I will talk to my aunt.

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,160
I won't allow her raise her hand against you.

142
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,520
Yeah, because they will ask you to allow them, right?

143
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,200
Because they were supposed to ask for your permission, right?

144
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
What does it matter if you let them or not?

145
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,560
That's enough. I won't stay in this house one more minute.

146
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,680
Nazan.

147
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,860
Please be calm. We can talk when I am home.

148
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,320
You still want to talk to <i>me</i> after all that?!

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,380
Come here, be a man and take care of your woman.

150
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,260
If you talk to your little brother, or to your aunt-

151
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,300
Cahit, don't bring yourself down.

152
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,480
Whatever happened is between your wife and me.

153
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,740
We both talk in a language we understand.

154
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,600
Go back to your work. Don't bother with our problems.

155
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,700
Is my lover stuck between two witches?

156
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,460
Elmas, please watch your mouth.

157
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,280
How many times do I have to tell you?

158
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,820
Don't stay next to me when I talk about personal things.

159
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,820
Sorry, Mister Cahit.

160
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,180
Seems like I have crossed a line as your mistress.

161
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,880
Elmas, I didn't mean it like that.

162
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,940
I-It's just...

163
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,520
Yeah, nevermind. Don't start to stutter right away.

164
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,480
I didn't come here to hear you talk anyway.

165
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,240
There was a small thing, that you wanted me to remind you.

166
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,800
You said you wanted me to buy the same jewelry you bought Mrs Nazan.

167
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,860
But don't buy from the same place, okay?

168
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,260
I love your cowardness.

169
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,260
Don't worry, I will go to another store.

170
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,640
I am not the whipping boy of this house, Mrs Aytul.

171
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,740
If you keep going like this, you will have a lot of beatings.

172
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,820
But not from me. From life itself.

173
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,740
If I ever hear the name of my daughter coming out of that sinister mouth of yours,

174
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,400
if you ever slander my daughter again,

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,760
you won't even have the chance to pack your things, before you end up through that door.

176
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,100
Let's see what you packed in that suitcase.

177
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
-Mrs Aytul! -Shh.

178
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Look at that.

179
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,430
You are taking all we gave you for your wedding.

180
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,530
What are you doing, Mrs Aytul?

181
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:53,530
I told you the first day when you tried to pit those two brothers against each other

182
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,360
one day if you leave this house

183
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,000
you will leave the way you came in as a bride, as 'tatters-wearing Nazan'.

184
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,930
Nazan, that's my last warning for you.

185
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,660
Don't try to separate what's blood and flesh.

186
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,330
Be well-behaved. Know you are a bride in this house.

187
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,230
Or else I am gonna hurt you really bad.

188
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,130
<i>Really bad</i>.

189
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,060
Cahit.

190
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,660
Can you come into my room? I want to talk with you about something.

191
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,530
So, Cahit...

192
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,330
I broke your heart with that tree issue yesterday.

193
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,900
I was being dumb. Please forgive me.

194
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,030
But you also know me.

195
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,400
I get blind with rage.

196
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,030
It's no matter, Yigit. We know each other.

197
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,960
It's true. It's true, but...

198
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,430
Well, with the farm, the company, work, Mert,

199
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,260
hospital and all, I tend to forget everything.

200
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,730
But one has to remember once in a while.

201
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,160
What? That we are big brothers and little brother?

202
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,130
Listen. You and I didn't get to spend time together for some time now.

203
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,460
Do you have work tonight?

204
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,330
-Let's do something together. -Fine for me.

205
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,660
Let's do that. I'll see you tonight.

206
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,960
The bus arrives at past 30 right.

207
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,160
So you really want to go down to the city?

208
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,360
Then do that, and search for a job till evening.

209
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,380
And then find Elmas and come back together. Where is the cacao?

210
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,470
Listen, you don't even have a phone.

211
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,470
Don't make me worry, okay?

212
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,450
Of course, aunt.

213
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,540
Where is Betül? The child's milk is getting cold.

214
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,150
It's alright, aunt. I can bring it to him.

215
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,660
Do that.

216
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,200
Where are you going? You don't even know where his room is?

217
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,530
Up the stairs, first room in front.

218
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,180
Don't take too much time. Mrs Aytul doesn't like people walking around.

219
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,170
Okay.

220
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,930
Mert?

221
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,300
Mert.

222
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,050
Are you okay?

223
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,260
Why are you crying?

224
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,820
I wanted to give a drawing to my dad.

225
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,170
I forgot.

226
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,410
My sweetie, is that a reason to cry?

227
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,170
Listen.

228
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,060
I will be going to Sister Elmas' workplace today.

229
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,700
If you want to I can bring your drawing to your dad.

230
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,850
Would you do that for me?

231
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,370
Of course.

232
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,330
But under one condition.

233
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,480
First you wipe away your tears

234
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,500
and if you take a big sip of your milk

235
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
I will bring it to him. Deal?

236
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,240
Deal.

237
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Let's go.

238
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,260
Here.

239
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,680
Give me the twenty-two.

240
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,240
Mister Yigit, there are some rumors regarding the Filo family?

241
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,840
I think they are going to speculate over our offer.

242
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
It would be good to be careful.

243
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,810
They should not take everything for granted.

244
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,080
A few rumors of cowards won't keep me from going my way.

245
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,450
Yigit, I also heard a few things this morning.

246
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,140
There is a serious monopolization going on with the Filo business, you know that.

247
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,210
They seem to be bothered. They think you are reaching out for too much.

248
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,210
What do you suggest? Twenty-four.

249
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,220
I think we should be more cautious.

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,300
Cautious?

251
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,650
Cautious, huh?

252
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,140
Just because some tires manufacturer cowards are scared of competition, we should watch out?

253
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,640
If someone thinks I am reaching out for too much

254
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,760
he should come in front of me, grab my hand and arm wrestle.

255
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,760
If he is stronger he will win.

256
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,760
If not...

257
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,680
that's what competition means to me.

258
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,620
I won't be cautious.

259
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,560
Muslum, start the car. I want to hear the motor.

260
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,730
Vural,

261
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,240
what does the computer say?

262
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,580
The fault recording system is clear now, Mister Yigit.

263
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,140
See? It wasn't the transmission.

264
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,920
It was three, four screws, wasn't it?

265
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,060
Stop the motor.

266
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,980
Call the owner to pick it up.

267
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,920
He is waiting for 3 days. His wife was driving me crazy.

268
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,920
Well, that's all.

269
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,700
Take it easy, guys.

270
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,770
In 10 minutes let's take a look at the new models together, okay?

271
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,500
Mister Yigit, the photoshoot in the gallery has started.

272
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Great. You go there.

273
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,260
If there is a problem tell me, okay?

274
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,260
-Of course. -10 minutes.

275
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,280
You said we wanted to look at the models.

276
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,050
Ah, yes.

277
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,680
I must have forgotten. I am coming.

278
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,940
Give me two minutes.

279
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,520
Good afternoon. I was looking for Elmas Celebi. I am her cousin, Nur.

280
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,490
One second.

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,860
Is Miss Elmas at her desk? Her cousin is here.

282
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,770
Okay.

283
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,210
-Miss Elmas left. -I see. Thank you.

284
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,600
If I gave you something, could you give it to Yigit Kozan?

285
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Of course. I can give it to his secretary.

286
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,210
Thank you.

287
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,770
Yes, Mister Yigit.

288
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,200
-Send Miss Nur to my office immediately. -Yes, Sir.

289
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,900
Excuse me. Mister Yigit wants to see you.

290
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,730
Me?

291
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,850
I am not here for him.

292
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,440
Please follow me.

293
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,500
Here. Please take a seat, he will be here any moment.

294
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,760
I was hanging up the drawing.

295
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,280
You forgot to take it. It's from Mert.

296
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,740
This door is always closed.

297
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,290
When I came the door was open.

298
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,290
And when I saw the drawings...

299
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,900
I am sorry.

300
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,900
Well.

301
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,720
Let's go out.

302
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,340
I don't understand.

303
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,600
Are you not here to meet with Elmas?

304
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,180
To go home?

305
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,250
If you didn't notice, Elmas isn't here. And we live in the same place.

306
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,940
Come on.

307
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,940
A really polite order, Mister Yigit.

308
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,220
And how do you know I am going back home?

309
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,010
Can't I go home alone, or what?

310
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,210
Also I count as a tourist in Istanbul

311
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,120
and I wanted to be shown around by Elmas.

312
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,500
Great. Then let's go.

313
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,920
I think you didn't understand. I said I am not going home.

314
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,280
Excuse me, Mister Yigit. For tomorrow's meeting-

315
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,010
Tomorrow.

316
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,260
-Mister Yigit, the faxes you asked for. -Sign them.

317
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,770
Can I get my bag, please?

318
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,210
Where are we going?

319
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,380
Well, didn't you say you are a tourist?

320
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,410
Let me guide you through Istanbul.

321
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,450
Are you seriously gonna show me Istanbul now?

322
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,450
Seriously.

323
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,160
We had our last vacation as a family in Istanbul.

324
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,980
One month after coming back my mom god sick.

325
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,380
Past month when my father's condition worsened

326
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,380
he said he wanted to come here again.

327
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,930
He never said it out loud but

328
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,530
I think it was because it was the last place we were happy as a family.

329
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,090
I found this in the garden this morning.

330
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,690
I can't believe it.

331
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,690
I thought I'd lost it.

332
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,180
Thank you very much.

333
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,310
You're welcome.

334
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,490
You really look like your mother.

335
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,490
I mean...

336
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,210
I saw it by accident while inspecting.

337
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,820
Do you need help?

338
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,840
The ones being in love, the ones being in love!

339
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
This way! This way!

340
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,170
We are not in love.

341
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,350
Take this! Snap! Snap!

342
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,710
Thank you.

343
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,120
But we are not in love.

344
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Very pretty. Very pretty.

345
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,100
Listen, young man.

346
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,400
In this time if you find a young girl who blushes when hearing about love,

347
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,650
don't ever lose her. Take her and never let go.

348
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,200
Well, uncle, it's true. But we are not in love.

349
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
How do you know? Is it written on our forehead?

350
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,000
My son, this is love.

351
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,480
It will be written on your forehead and sparkle in your eyes.

352
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,770
Are you sure it's not the flash of your camera?

353
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,040
We are not lovers.

354
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,670
I am not saying you have found each other.

355
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,670
I am saying you are in love.

356
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,900
Even so you are wrong...

357
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,370
take this money. Keep the change. Thank you.

358
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,760
God bless you. Thank you.

359
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,840
Take it easy, uncle. Thanks.

360
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,460
Here for you.

361
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,010
An Istanbul memory.

362
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,420
We look ugly.

363
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,290
What if she got lost?

364
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,720
What if something happened to her? It's huge Istanbul.

365
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,100
How could I send her without a phone?

366
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,740
As if she would have stayed.

367
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,760
You could tie her up, but she would still find a way, that disrespectful girl.

368
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,640
Don't be like this Mister Tayyar. When was she disrespectful?

369
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,810
First yesterday and today is the second time.

370
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,810
She is this late on the first day!

371
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,810
What was it? She is searching for a job?

372
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,330
She is here to party, your beloved niece. To party!

373
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:27,900
(sings along)

374
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,800
''Who do I have in Istanbul...?''

375
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,220
You are the worst.

376
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,730
Iclal, what are you doing?! Iclal!

377
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,380
What do you think you are doing?

378
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,420
What do you think you are doing?!

379
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,010
I'm driving, can't you see?

380
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,730
I- I am sorry. I...

381
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,420
-was just joki- -Sorry.

382
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,940
Sorry, I...

383
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,470
I just don't like joking around while driving.

384
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,010
It's very dangerous.

385
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,510
When your wife died in a car crash,...

386
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,480
where you the one driving?

387
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,810
I am sorry.

388
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,980
Forgive me.

389
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,980
I am really sorry.

390
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,540
Yes, okay, Cahit. I understand.

391
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,830
Do what you want.

392
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,860
Yigit and Cahit are gonna eat out today, wherever{ that came from.

393
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,980
They weren't going out for a while now.

394
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,120
They will probably have a night of (heavy drinking).

395
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,070
Aunt, I also want a night of (heavy drinking).

396
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,340
First of all grow up, then you can have your night outs.

397
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,310
Aunt, you are quite today.

398
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,820
I am a little tired.

399
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,400
Mert, you know your father won't come tonight. Why are you watching the window?

400
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
I am not waiting for dad, I am waiting for Nur.

401
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,100
Who is Nur?

402
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
The niece of Mrs Hafize.

403
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,260
She was supposed to give dad my picture.

404
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
What do you mean?

405
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,500
She is everywhere to be found.

406
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,640
Once in the car, Once on the tree. She was very excited to be inside the house.

407
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,210
She had a weird way of looking at the rooms and the furniture.

408
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,200
She has a pretty sly and swagger persona.

409
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,190
One must have a talk with Mrs Hafize.

410
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,780
If she came to stay in the outbuilding, she should stay there.

411
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,130
I don't want a stranger like her to linger in the house.

412
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,880
I want that! I love Nur a lot!

413
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,880
I don't care! I want her to come!

414
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
This boy...

415
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,000
It was a very nice day.

416
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,770
I liked Yigit Kozan's Istanbul a lot.

417
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,500
Thank you.

418
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,440
Nur.

419
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,930
Istanbul was prettier with you.

420
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,920
Listen, Hafize.

421
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,960
Sit down for once. Don't make me break your legs.

422
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,600
For the love of God, please don't stop me. I can't stay here, all worried...

423
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,630
Hafize!

424
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,330
Girl, where were you?!

425
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,070
I'm sorry, aunt.

426
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,580
Listen to me, Miss Nur.

427
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,370
This is not your father's house.

428
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,720
You can't just stay out how you like and come home at this late hour. Got it?

429
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,780
-(whispers)Don't... -Is this a hotel?! Is this a hotel?!

430
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,270
I am sorry, uncle. I was stuck in traffic.

431
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,870
My God...

432
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,250
You can't just do that to me, Girl. This is Istanbul.

433
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,370
I won't let you go out if that happens again.

434
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,140
Whatever... Let's eat dinner.

435
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,250
Aunt, I'll just drop my bag upstairs real quick.

436
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,250
-Can you take this, too? -Sure.

437
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,250
Go out of my way!

438
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,410
Fights every day, a fuss everyday.

439
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,170
Yigit, do you listen?

440
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,160
I'm listening. I'm listening. Sorry.

441
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,420
Nazan here, my aunt there,...

442
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,420
I never feel like going home.

443
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:58,570
Sometimes when I talk to Nazan, I get so close to asking for divorce, but...

444
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,440
I can't.

445
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,500
And then there is this guilt, because of that Devil...

446
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,890
-Devil?

447
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,040
Devil.  The tempting charming devil. [He is hinting on an affair.]

448
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,040
You?

449
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
You...? On Nazan?

450
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,120
No way.

451
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,770
I wouldn't, would I? I am always the nice guy.

452
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,090
Even though my wife is asking 'Are you a man?' every other sentence...

453
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,090
I would never fall for the devil.

454
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,910
And If I had fallen, I would be caught in guilt like this.

455
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,220
Look at me, Cahit.

456
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
If you are a ******, just admit it like a man.

457
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,820
Or divorce like a man.

458
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,060
Am I a man, huh?

459
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,390
Come on.

460
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,560
Don't make me talk now.

461
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,000
Even if it's hard sometimes, it's been so many years

462
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,800
I can't divorce her after all this time and send her back to her family home.

463
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,440
Yeah, it surely is difficult.

464
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,880
It's difficult, Yigit, so difficult.

465
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,890
Look at you.

466
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,020
You couldn't even divorce your wife who is asleep for 3 years.

467
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
You didn't love her even for a day.

468
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,280
I even married while being in love. A marriage out of love.

469
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,000
You... got pressured by our aunt.

470
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,670
Because your big brother couldn't produce a successor for the big Kozans Family.

471
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,820
I got more luck than you did...

472
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,770
I even fell in love with my wife's never ending chatter.

473
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,490
Listen, Cahit. I didn't believe in love.

474
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,490
Love...

475
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,600
... how do I say it...

476
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,910
...is made up by romance movies.

477
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,020
Like something that people with free time use to feel better about themselves.

478
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,530
Would you wait for a feeling you believe to not exist?

479
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,900
You wouldn't wait.

480
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,200
But before that...

481
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,240
had I believed in love just for a second....

482
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,340
'Before'?

483
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,010
Before what?

484
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,580
Before the tourist.

485
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,650
What tourist?

486
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,140
Is she a russian?

487
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,930
Listen, Cahit.

488
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,930
Imagine a pair of green eyes.

489
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,470
In those same eyes...

490
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:38,430
you see someone who challenges everyone and everything...

491
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,170
but also you see compassion.

492
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,880
You see the urge to stand one's ground, in those eyes... in her face.

493
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,970
Not to give up. To fight.

494
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,520
It's such a thing that...

495
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,700
even if she fights with you because of a tree,...

496
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,700
she helps you to make peace with yourself.

497
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,180
Is it a russian?

498
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,420
You *****, let's go.

499
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,090
Excuse me.

500
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,200
It felt like I have placed a huge city inside my heart today.

501
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,720
Yigit Kozan's Istanbul lives inside of me.

502
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,570
Yigit. His glances.

503
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,370
His smell.

504
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,070
His laugh.

505
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,070
His words.

506
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,250
Yigit Kozan, what have you done to me?

507
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,410
When did you do it?

508
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,500
Wait, Cahit. Wait.

509
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Wait, Cahit.

510
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,080
Ok, ok.

511
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,120
I am not drunk, I can go on my own.

512
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,000
-Are you sure? -Yes.

513
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,200
Drink a soda and Ayran[turkish drink made of yoghurt], it will help.

514
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,030
Love...

515
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,350
Love is actually something you can grasp with your hands.

516
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,540
In your body. Something you can feel in every part of you.

517
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,630
Like the cramps in your belly.

518
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,810
Like the cold sweat you feel on your body whenever you see them.

519
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,950
The love, I believed to be non-existent for years,...

520
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,970
is just as real as the blood that flows through my veins.

521
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,080
But while the blood that flows through my veins keeps me alive,

522
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,200
this kills me.

523
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,800
Betül is still sick with the flu.

524
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,200
Would you bring this milk and cookies to Mert?

525
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,410
Nur, I am talking to you.

526
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,720
Would you bring this milk with cookies to Mert?

527
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,720
Sure, Aunt.

528
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,030
But don't get distracted like yesterday!

529
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,600
Yes.

530
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,180
Come on, my horse!

531
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,630
Fly me away, fly me to the sky!

532
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,750
Come on, my flying horse! Fly!

533
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,750
Good morning, little man.

534
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,020
Hey! Why didn't you come yesterday?

535
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,380
I couldn't. But I did keep my promise.

536
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,920
I did give the picture to your dad.

537
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,510
Yey!

538
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,570
The picture you are looking at is my mother's.

539
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,860
She's very pretty.

540
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,310
The sky, huh?

541
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,640
You like the clouds?

542
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,770
That's not the sky. That's heaven.

543
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,610
And I don't like the clouds at all.

544
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,550
Because they hide my mother.

545
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,710
But one day she will come back.

546
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,710
The clouds will let my mother go.

547
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,170
Maybe then I can make peace with the clouds.

548
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,980
What do you think is heaven like?

549
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,960
You said it already.

550
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,340
Like the sky.

551
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,130
Without things to hold you down. Infinite.

552
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,260
Is it blue?

553
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,260
I don't know.

554
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,370
Maybe it's blue.

555
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,410
Or maybe it's in colors we have never seen.

556
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,230
I will know what kind of place it is anyways.

557
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,620
When my mom comes back, she is going to tell me.

558
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,500
I am going to tell you after, I promise.

559
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,060
Did you know...

560
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,230
my mother and father are also in heaven.

561
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,390
-Both at the same time? -Yeah.

562
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,140
Don't be sad. When my mom comes back, she can bring them along, too.

563
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,040
What are you doing here?

564
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,530
I brought milk and cookies for Mert.

565
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,530
This is not your job.

566
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,690
Dad, grandma got angry at Nur.

567
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,930
What's wrong, Aunt?

568
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,870
-I should-      -This is not your home, little Miss.

569
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,070
You can't just walk around the rooms as you please.

570
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,400
If you are talking about the fact that Nur spends time with Mert...

571
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,880
I am very pleased with that.

572
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,500
What is that supposed to mean, Yigit?

573
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,810
Do we need a stranger to take care of Mert?
