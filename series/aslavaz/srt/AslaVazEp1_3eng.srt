1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,100
Mr Yigit, could you please go out of my way. I want to leave.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,200
Mert. My son.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,200
Go downstairs with Nur.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,940
Wait for me in the garden.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,400
Hurry up.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,540
What's happening, Yigit? Did you think this girl is a babysitter?

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,140
Mert likes the girl.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,440
It's a girl who is staying in the outbuilding for 2 days now.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,080
We don't know her.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,080
Why should she take care of Mert?!

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,940
Also she is quietly sneaking around the house since yesterday.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,540
Something I don't like at all.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,530
I am very pleased that Nur spends time with Mert.

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,740
I am done. That's all.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,980
Look how I walk. You won't let go, will you?

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,290
I am holding you tight, don't worry.

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,470
My grandma would be mad if she saw us.

18
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,570
Grandma?

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,660
Did you know who my grandma is?

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,790
He is the aunt of my father and also the mother of my mom.

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,170
She is always angry, don't be sad about it.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,170
She can't get angry at my dad only.

23
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,690
Did you know? Noone can be angry at my dad.

24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,690
Why can't noone be angry at your dad?

25
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,050
Because he is super!

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,670
Look, there he comes, your Superman.

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,590
Dad!

28
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,200
Dad, can we go to the amusement park?

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,940
We can. I promised you, didn't I?

30
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,360
Yey! Nur should come, too!

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,700
I am sorry, little man, U can't. I wish you a lot of fun.

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,020
But it's no fun with my dad.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,410
Sorry?

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,540
Why is that?

35
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,390
My dad doesn't even ride the carousel with me, because he is scared he might lose his charisma.

36
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,090
He always let's me win at the electric cars, because he knows I can't win on my own.

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,700
If you come, we can be a team and win against him.

38
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,280
I really can't go, Mert.

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Dad, what is she saying?

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,930
Son, you go run to the car.

41
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,170
Go, wait for us. Come on.

42
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,900
Mr Yigit, maybe I couldn't make myself clear.

43
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,500
You still say 'us'. I say I have things to do.

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,650
Can't you see, the kid really wants you.

45
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,930
Don't make him sad.

46
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,610
This time I won't listen to your orders.

47
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,120
Are you mad at me?

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,390
No. I am not mad.

49
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,410
I should be thankful for your last heroic action.

50
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,410
I am so ungrateful again.

51
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,410
First you don't look at me.

52
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,060
And then you play lawyer infront of your mother-in-law, your aunt, for me.

53
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,290
I didn't know you married a relative.

54
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,270
Whatever, I am asking you: What's going on?

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,820
Are you always so straight forward?

56
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,770
Yes.

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,580
Perfect. So just like me.

58
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,760
Nice, I will also be straight forward.

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,970
Come on, we are going.

60
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,660
What are you doing? Are you insane?

61
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,670
Didn't you get that I am insane yesterday already?

62
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,120
-I said, we are going. Come on. -What am I going to say to my aunt?

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,770
You will say 'It was Mr Yigit's orders', what else?

64
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,330
-I am not taking orders from you, Mr Yigit.

65
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,940
Everyone is taking orders from me, but you don't have to.

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,940
You take orders from that little man, can you?

67
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,770
----

68
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,920
Did you get angry at my dad a moment ago?

69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,180
No way.

70
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,370
How dare I?

71
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,780
Who can get angry with Superman?

72
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,910
I've seen it. I did.

73
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,530
You did get angry with him.

74
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,020
You won't come with us, will you?

75
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,960
He is gonna lose on purpose at the cars again.

76
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,140
I am coming.

77
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,940
Just to win over your dad.

78
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,940
Hooray! Yey!

79
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,860
He turned yellow immediately.

80
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,530
And punished the trickster weavers.

81
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,730
So, son.

82
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,930
Another fairy tale is finished.

83
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,540
Did you like it?

84
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,170
I liked it, but

85
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,170
today was better.

86
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,050
Today was really great for me also.

87
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,050
It was nice, but

88
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,170
the amusement park was nice, too.

89
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,880
Come on, time to go to sleep.

90
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,250
Make yourself ready.

91
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,020
What's going on, child. Why do you get grumpy?

92
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,440
I am ashamed to face mother.

93
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,640
Why?

94
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,530
I laughed a lot, that's why.

95
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,340
What if mother sees me from heaven and gets sad.

96
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,660
What if she thinks I don't miss her and that's why she isn't coming back.

97
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,660
Come here.

98
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,460
Mothers don't sulk about that.

99
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,940
Mothers always want their children to be happy.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,760
They wouldn't want them to be sad.

101
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,760
Ok?

102
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,150
Hooray. That means mother probably just laughed as much as I did, today.

103
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,530
Surely.

104
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,730
Good that Nur came, too.

105
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,300
Nur is now my best friend.

106
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
She will never leave, right?

107
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,660
She won't leave.

108
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,560
She won't leave.

109
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,730
I promise.

110
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,670
What does this silly man do to me?

111
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,120
One day he shows me Istanbul,

112
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,100
then he walks the other way when he sees me.

113
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,820
What does he do to me?

114
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,530
I couldn't sleep.

115
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,280
I walked around and ended up at the lake.

116
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,560
I also come to the lake when I can't sleep.

117
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,920
That's a good idea.

118
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,920
Good night.

119
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,730
Nur.

120
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,390
Don't leave.

121
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,200
What are you doing to me, Yigit Kozan?!

122
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,480
What's your problem with me?! What's your problem?!

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
What do you want from me?!

124
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,260
Since the first day I met you, what are you doing to me?!

125
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,920
One day you make me feel like I am flying,

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,540
the next day you bury me under the ground.

127
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,010
One day, I see myself in your eyes,

128
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,120
the next day, the eyes that look at me are blind.

129
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,090
What are you doing to me?!

130
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,440
I am this type of man.

131
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,890
One day, I don't see anything other than you,

132
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,080
the next day, I can't look you in the face.

133
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,040
That's the type of man I am.

134
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,600
Don't get fooled by my boldness.

135
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,240
Everything I have done in my life, I've done with a certain bravery.

136
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
But in front of you...

137
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,200
I turn into a weak and helpless coward.

138
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,020
I have to run away from you, Nur.

139
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,840
Do you understand?

140
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,020
I have to run away from you.

141
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,080
You are brave and you are a coward.

142
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,360
You are both.

143
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,120
And I accept both.

144
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,770
Who ever runs away, can run away.

145
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,090
But one should stay.

146
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,370
He should stay with me.

147
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,290
Something happened to me.

148
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,840
For the first time,

149
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,250
for the first time in my life,

150
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,460
something has happened to me when I saw you for the first time.

151
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,190
Yigit.

152
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,120
I am also afraid.

153
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,610
What is even 'afraid'?

154
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,610
I am terrified.

155
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,530
Because what ever happened to you

156
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,530
it also happened to me.

157
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,810
I have fallen in love with you.

158
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,420
I have fallen in love with you, too.

159
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,220
Yigit.

160
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,580
Will we have to hide like this for ever?

161
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,050
Sometimes when I look at my aunt's or Elmas' face, I'm scared.

162
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,470
Like it is written on my forehead, that I am in love with Yigit Kozan.

163
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,890
'I am in love with him infront of your eyes, can't you see?', is what I am thinking.

164
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,220
I want to share my happiness.

165
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,730
And then....

166
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,580
I remember my father.

167
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,450
He isn't even dead for 40 days,

168
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,750
and this happiness that has swept me off my feet,

169
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,780
at the wrong time

170
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,640
feels like too much.

171
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,210
At the wrong time?

172
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,530
Yes.

173
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,370
This love came at the wrong time.

174
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,800
We were caught to abruptly by this.

175
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,090
Without questions, without answers. From one day to another.

176
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,100
---------

177
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,700
We want no one to know, but

178
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,300
one day they all will.

179
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,530
Ah! A lamb!

180
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,750
So silly, look.

181
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,220
Come here!

182
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,780
Got'cha.

183
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,370
Loot at me.

184
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,920
The great Yigit Kozan is turned into a shepherd, thanks to you.

185
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,010
Are you complaining, 'great Yigit Kozan'?

186
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,250
Come here.

187
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,800
Aw, my love.

188
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,110
Are you without your mother?

189
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,990
Nur.

190
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,510
I love you.

191
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,510
I love you, too.

192
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,110
Let's go.

193
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,170
My dear.

194
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,090
My baby.

195
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,670
Our little one is gonna flip out.

196
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,120
Our?

197
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,120
I mean 'yours'. Mert.

198
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,740
Our...

199
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,630
You really love Mert.

200
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,410
How could I not?

201
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,490
I wish I could do more for him than this lamb, the games and the paintings.

202
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,950
Yigit.

203
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,730
I didn't ask you before, but I am very curious.

204
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,280
Have you ever brought Mert to a psychiatrist?

205
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,510
For what reason?

206
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,510
The reason?

207
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,850
Your son is still waiting for his dead mother...

208
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,620
I think he has wrong ideas about death.

209
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,350
He thinks that people can come back from heaven.

210
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,120
Is that not reason enough?

211
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,740
Mert is still very young.

212
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,270
He is not too young to understand death in a healthy way.

213
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,710
And...

214
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,260
why isn't Mert in school? Why did you get a doctors note?

215
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,380
Why doesn't he go to school?

216
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,590
Listen, your son can't live waiting for his mother.

217
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,780
Yigit, I don't want to upset you, but

218
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,450
you have to see that.

219
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,610
It's too much for a small child. It's too heavy for a burden.

220
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,000
How do you know what is a heavy burden and what not?

221
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,290
I do everything to make it easier for my son.

222
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,140
Everything. Do you understand?!

223
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,090
I don't.

224
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,610
I am really trying to understand, but I don't.

225
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,960
Yigit. My love.

226
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,320
Where is Mert's mother's grave?

227
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,680
Did Mert ever visit her grave?

228
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,900
He didn't, did he?

229
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,900
I thought so.

230
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,050
Listen, I am not a psychiatrist.

231
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,230
But the only thing Mert needs is to say good bye to his mother in a true way.

232
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,320
If you give him that and bring him to his mother's grave-

233
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,170
Enough!

234
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,640
I am Mert's parent. Do you get it?!

235
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,530
I am Mert's father!!

236
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,640
Who are you? Who are you?

237
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,060
I know what's the best, the healthiest and most right for my son.

238
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,620
His mother, nor his mother's grave, nor anything else regarding his mother,

239
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,620
has anything to do with you!

240
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,800
You piece of shit. You scumbag, asshole!

241
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,610
To whom am I even talking to?

242
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,770
Dad!

243
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,150
Dad!

244
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,700
Look, I got you a new friend!

245
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,820
Come here, come here.

246
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,280
Dad, did you get a lamb?!

247
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,230
Yes, maybe now you will stop playing with the chickens for once.

248
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,040
We were only lacking of a lamb.

249
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,750
Nur, look at my lamb!

250
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,710
Come, let's pet it together.

251
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,160
He is super smart and calm.

252
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,260
Dad, Nur didn't like my lamb at all.

253
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,770
I love you more than myself, Yigit Kozan.

254
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,020
Even though I knew that you didn't love me

255
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,230
I want to spend the rest of my life believing that one day you will love me.

256
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,470
There is no chance that I will, Iclal.

257
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,860
I don't believe in that type of love.

258
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,860
Love.

259
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,860
Don't you believe in love?

260
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,650
I believe in the brain, the mind, and what is right.

261
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,360
Just like my aunt said,

262
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,930
that you and I are together is right, but two rights don't make a wrong.

263
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,240
We can marry.

264
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,240
You don't love me.

265
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,130
You don't even see me.

266
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,000
While you play with your son, your horses, your cars,

267
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,740
I rot away at this farm with nothing but my love for you.

268
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,700
Every day you don't love me, I wither away a little more.

269
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,700
I didn't promise you love.

270
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,700
I didn't promise that I will be in love with you.

271
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,210
You are killing me.

272
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,970
By not loving me, you are killing me.

273
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,660
Listen, Iclal. I want to divorce you.

274
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,170
Do you understand? I want to divorce you.

275
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,800
-You want to divorce me, is that right? -Yes.

276
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,460
-You want to build a life without me? -Yes.

277
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,840
But for me there is no life without you, Yigit.

278
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,820
If there is no you, then there is also no life.

279
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,720
I am sorry, Iclal.

280
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,120
I am sorry.

281
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,820
For every moment I haven't loved you,

282
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,680
for every moment I couldn't... I am sorry.

283
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,800
Hello Mr Isam, there is something important we need to take care of.

284
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,000
I need you to be really fast.

285
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,200
I want to divorce my wife,

286
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,450
who is in coma for 3 years.

287
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,300
The worry of the one who is on her feet is worse, than the one who is asleep.

288
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,970
While she's sleeping peacefully, dreaming,

289
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,210
you are the one who has to suffer.

290
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,840
Just imagining the pain of a mother like you are...

291
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,210
I hope there is no grandchild.

292
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,030
I believe her husband doesn't visit too often as well.

293
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,180
I want Iclal's nurse to be switched immediately.

294
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,020
Was there a problem, madam?

295
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,190
I am not happy with the nurse. I want it to be taken care of today.

296
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,830
Sure.

297
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,920
Yigit?

298
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,920
I am at the hospital.

299
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,550
Where did you say?

300
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,220
That's close anyway. I am on my way.

301
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,190
I thought you are at the company.

302
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,530
I had stuff to take care of.

303
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,460
Are you in a bad mood?

304
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,460
Did something happen?

305
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,210
No, nothing.

306
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,610
I am pretty well.

307
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,970
There are just a few documents you have to sign.

308
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,260
What are these?

309
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,680
Nothing. Just a few formalities regarding the company's stocks.

310
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,890
You have to sign, too.

311
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,010
Let me get my glasses. You know I can't see close up.

312
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,870
You don't have to read it, aunt. It's just simple formalities.

313
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,580
Just sign and forget it.

314
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,210
Yeah? Well.

315
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,850
Here.

316
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,440
Like this?

317
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,780
-Is this the same? -Yeah, all the same.

318
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,440
Here you go.

319
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,530
Did you make me rush here just for a few documents?

320
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,530
I am sorry for the trouble.

321
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,620
I really had to hurry with this.

322
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,610
That's all.

323
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,870
We will go greet Emir at the bus terminal in the evening. You will make it, right?

324
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,990
I will! I missed him like crazy.

325
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,200
Hello Mr Yigit.

326
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,070
Ah, Nur! Be here before 4pm, or else you won't find anyone home.

327
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,050
Nur.

328
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,680
-Out of my way. -Where are you going? -None of your business.

329
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,170
I said 'where'?

330
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,700
Down to the city. I have stuff to do.

331
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,550
Ok, let me drive you.

332
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,610
What?

333
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,560
Why are you so surprised? Jump in and I'll drive you.

334
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,120
It seems like you don't understand. I said I have stuff to do.

335
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,840
Will you get in the car on your own?

336
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,610
Or should I force you?

337
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,060
Here we are.

338
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,460
Speak. I am listening.

339
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,400
I am sorry, Nur.

340
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,140
I apologize.

341
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,280
You brought me all the way here just to apologize?

342
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,920
What are you going to do, if I don't forgive you? Tell me.

343
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,260
You broke my heart using force, are you going to heal it with force, too?

344
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,380
Yes.

345
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,840
I broke your heart using force.

346
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,060
I forced myself to break it.

347
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,520
But none of my words came from my soul.

348
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,070
It was out of fear.

349
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,070
Out of desperation.

350
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,840
Desperate? You are desperate?

351
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,650
What have I done to make you feel this way?

352
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,650
What have I done to make you so afraid?

353
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,650
You made me fall in love.

354
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,650
You made me fall in love, Nur.

355
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,400
I was scared. I am scared.

356
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,850
I know I will spend my life being scared of losing you.

357
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,050
Listen.

358
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,360
Come here.

359
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,030
Come, lay your head down.

360
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,410
Look.

361
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,570
My love is irritable and rough, because it is filled with fears.

362
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,140
Because we are inside.

363
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,030
I can't promise to never make you sad.

364
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,900
But I promise you,

365
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,420
as long as you are next to me,

366
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,000
this world will be a safer place for you.

367
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,160
Look at me.

368
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,750
I get sad because of you.

369
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,020
But I have no one to complain about you other than you.

370
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,040
I am here. I am here.

371
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,840
Listen, Nur. Right here and now.

372
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,970
Say yes to the biggest command I will ever have for you.

373
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,830
Nur.

374
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,520
Marry me.

375
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,080
This is dumb.

376
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,380
This is insanity.

377
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,500
This doesn't make any sense.

378
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,370
Yes. Yes, it doesn't make any sense.

379
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,380
You are the one thing that made no sense to me.

380
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,010
You still have a chance to get away. If you don't accept now, you still can get away.

381
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,280
But if you say yes...-

382
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,280
Yes.

383
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:18,940
Yes. Now I can't get away from you Yigit Kozan.

384
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,490
I love you, Nur.

385
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:48,020
I love you with all my heart, with all my existence as much as a man could ever possibly love a woman.

386
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,770
I love you.

387
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,540
Whenever I look at you, I forget myself so much

388
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,080
that I end up saying 'Yes' a million times.

389
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,530
And every 'Yes' makes me find myself more in you, that's how much I love you, Yigit Kozan.

390
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,800
Is he asleep?

391
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,920
Yes, he is.

392
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,120
At first he was demanding his lamb, but after hearing a bedtime story, he forgot.

393
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,890
I see you never let go of that phone, do you?

394
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,050
Brother...

395
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,530
Cahit, it's okay. She is a young woman.

396
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,340
Where is Yigit?

397
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,280
I don't like the way he is the past couple days.

398
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,160
He seems so tense.

399
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,750
Everything is fine at the company, right?

400
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,320
There is nothing bad I know of.

401
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,610
Did you also had to sign those documents?

402
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,390
What documents?

403
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,390
I also don't really know.

404
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,010
He made me sign them the other day.

405
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,300
He said some minor formalities regarding smaller stocks.

406
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
I really have no idea.

407
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,420
Yigit. Yigit, wait.

408
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,110
How could we not think of anything?

409
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,810
How can I go inside like this?

410
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,260
What are we going to say to my aunt, to your aunt?

411
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,240
She is the mother of your deceased wife, too.

412
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Everyone will be shocked.

413
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,250
And Mert?

414
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,610
What if he starts hating me? What if he doesn't like me?

415
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,220
What did we do?

416
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,020
-How could we just- -Ok, ok. Calm down.

417
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,660
Look at me.

418
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,360
Look me in the eyes.

419
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,770
From now on, it's going to be us. Us.

420
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,250
You, me and Mert.

421
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,170
There is no one I have to explain myself to in this house other than Mert.

422
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,810
Trust me.

423
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,410
Brother!

424
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,490
What's going on, Yaren?

425
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,710
Brother, it's brother Yigit.

426
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,550
What's with your brother?

427
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,550
My brother...

428
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,830
Yaren, speak for once! Don't worry us. What's going on?

429
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,830
Aunt...

430
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,110
My brother has married.

431
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,090
What?

432
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,340
What are you saying, Yaren?

433
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,670
Brother, what have you done?

434
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,770
After my wife has kissed the hand of my aunt,

435
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,260
after that I will talk to you all.

436
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,920
Wife?

437
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,920
What wife?

438
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,300
Did he say 'my wife'?

439
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,890
Wif- Shame on you.

440
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,460
Shame on you.

441
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,960
I will talk to all of you.

442
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,490
Be quiet.

443
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,000
You don't have an aunt.

444
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,430
I will never forgive you.

445
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,000
Even if I die here now because of my pain,

446
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,200
I will not forgive you!

447
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,520
Shame on you.

448
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,590
What is this?

449
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,930
Come, Nur. Let me bring you to the bedroom.

450
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,780
-Aunt. -Shame on you. Shame on you. How can this be?

451
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Shame on you.

452
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,480
Come.

453
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,490
Come, my love. Sit down.

454
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,630
Sit down.

455
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,260
It is my fault.

456
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,020
It's all my fault.

457
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,340
First I will go downstairs and talk to them.

458
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,800
Then we'll talk.

459
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,250
There are important things I have to tell you.

460
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,290
Trust me.

461
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,320
Yigit.

462
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,700
I trust you.

463
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,930
Brother, have you gone mad?

464
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,720
I don't understand anything. Aren't you already married?

465
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,060
I can't deal with you, too.

466
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,840
I didn't want it to go down like this.

467
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,480
But what can I do? It's happened.

468
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,660
I didn't see any other way.

469
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,390
-Listen carefully now. I- -You!

470
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,120
You....

471
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,880
You tricked me.

472
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,770
You made me sign a letter of attorney.

473
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,410
You tricked me and divorced your wife.

474
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,450
You divorced my daughter by using my signature!

475
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,450
Shame on you.

476
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,590
Shame on you!

477
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:16,850
I wasn't just your aunt, I was like your mother!

478
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,950
I was like your father!

479
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,740
What did you do?

480
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,100
You divorced my daughter.

481
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,560
In addition you married your servant's niece

482
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,300
who was a beggar just yesterday.

483
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,800
Shame on you.

484
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,360
Shame on you!

485
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,360
What else can I say to you?

486
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Shame on you.

487
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,720
Could I have any more words left for you?

488
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,570
What else is left there to say other than 'shame on you' now?

489
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,620
Are you insane, Brother? Are you insane? What are you doing?!

490
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,910
I bet he didn't even make her sign a prenup.

491
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,150
Yigit, for the love of God, what have you done?

492
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,520
Enough!

493
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,290
I've fallen in love!

494
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,790
I have fallen in love!

495
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,790
I loved her, I married her!

496
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,030
Nur is my wife.

497
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,030
My wife!

498
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,540
You can be shocked!

499
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,390
You can be angry! You can hit me!

500
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,080
Do what you want!

501
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,000
But you will accept that!

502
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,160
Nur is my wife.

503
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,530
Mr Yigit?

504
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,890
Hello Mr Yigit, can you hear me?

505
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,920
Good news! Your wife has woken up.

506
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,310
Mr Yigit, do you hear me?

507
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,310
I am saying your wife is awake!

508
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,370
Mr Yigit, congratulations.

509
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,180
Hello, Mr Yigit?

510
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,140
Hello? Can you hear me?

511
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,140
Mr Yigit?
