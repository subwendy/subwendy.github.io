he is punished

208
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
he should already be a good kid since he is in the first grade of school

209
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,430
he had a report for half semester

210
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,430
he didn't go to school since that

211
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,430
he became more perky,everyday different problems he makes

212
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
don't indulgence on him

213
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920

236
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820

241
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
and next time don't say stuff like this about your mom

242
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820

243
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820

244
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120

245
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,860
this big guy is you in here

246
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,640
the one is an angel is mom

247
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,473
her wings are so big

248
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,473
she clapped her wings and came to see us

249
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,060
you gave me a man word

250
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,060
don't forget

251
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,050
there is a pond you see it?

252
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,050
and then...

253
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,050
behind there is ranch

254
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
we have everything here including cows and sheep as you understand

255
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
very nice

256
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,100
just like our village

257
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
my dad would have been happy to see it

258
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
yeah..

259
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
just like our place

260
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
in Istanbul but away from the town

261
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
anyways,once weekend arrive we can take you to real istanbul

262
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,380
if you ever get stuck in this farm like my mom,you cant say that you live in stanbul

263
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
you look like bored of being here

264
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
to be honest if Mr yigit wasn't existing if would probably blasted in here

265
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,060
i work with him as you know

266
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,060
at Kozan's

267
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
in a huge plaza

268
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
in the middle of town called Levent

269
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
in the belly of civilization as you understand

270
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
i will drive

271
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
what an aggressive man

272
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
he looks like he is upset of something

273
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
i feel bad for you.it must be tough for you to work with this guy

274
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
i cant really say that Mr Yigit is the easiest person in the world

275
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
but he is the biggest chance in my live

276
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
the only chance to work with him

277
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
he is very nice guy

278
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
he looks like he think himself only with his money

279
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:36,903
you shouldn't think that he was born with the money

280
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,260
he was created his own luck

281
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
ripped off his luck by himself

282
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
step by step he went to target by himself

283
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
he was never surrender to anyone

284
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
he was grown without mother and father in huge Istanbul

285
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
who knows...

286
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,840
the money he has probably nothing comparing the sweat back then

287
00:21:57,827 --> 00:22:01,060
he is big man, very big...obviously if a person get big as him gets tough as well of course.

288
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
but his inside is different

289
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:08,727
macho tough and as like you said sometimes he is unpolite

290
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
but his inside is very different

291
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
with his son he is completely different person

292
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,220
he has son?

293
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
i wish his wife patience then

294
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,430
his wife was the one in curly hair??

295
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:23,203
no way!

296
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,360
that witch is a wife of his brother Cahit

297
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
stop gossiping girl

298
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,450

323
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020

this is Istanbul not Adana

327
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:39,740
over here,the bread is in the lion's stomach not in the mouth

328
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,740
especially person like you never seen university

329
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,307
oh

330
00:24:44,577 --> 00:24:46,960
if you think to make money in a different way,then i don't know..

331
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,260
incase if you didn't come to earn your money with the right way

332
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:56,240
incase if you think you will make money with your young and beauty,that i don't know

333
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
forgive the god,what kind of conversation are you talking about Mr Tayyar

334
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:06,120
i just wanted to warn her in the beginning so i don't get in trouble...look me me girl.

335
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,880
if you came here to make money with your beauty then i will have serious business,just to let you know

336
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,740
i didn't come here to believe my beauty,came here to believe my knowledgement

338
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760

and then i will continue my university hopefully

341
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,240
hopefully

342
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,730
you would probably want to move out your own place in the future too

343
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,243
right?

344
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,243
hopefully that will happen too

345
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:39,243
i don't want to be a weight for you guys

346
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,340

348
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:50,477
his daughter became a shelter of Tayyar's home that never liked me

349
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480

486
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
3 years ago

487
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,440
he misses his mom a lot

488
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
he doesn't accept that his mom is dead

489
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,660

490
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880

492
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,860

493
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,740
you know that we started with a mistake

494
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,740
everything was set by my aunt

495
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,700

00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:47,227

00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,140

499
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,140

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
you want to divorce me right?

501
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440

503
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,663

what are you doing Iclal.let it go

506
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Iclal can open her eyes anytime,she can open her eyes now or after years..

507
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,360
or she will never wake up

508
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:48,787
3 years.3years the only thing you guys make me memorized is when a mother of my son will wake up

509
00:40:48,787 --> 00:40:50,787
when?

510
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:52,787
time is ticking

511
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
your wife would be always sleeping too

512
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:11,127
we all get wound while living...big, small, deep

513
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,100
we all have many wounds in our life..

514
00:41:15,927 --> 00:41:17,927
time makes some of the wound become shell

515
00:41:20,203 --> 00:41:22,887
some of them hard to see,or cant feel it

516
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:29,030
but some of them even though only scar left,it still can be bleeding...

517
00:41:30,723 --> 00:41:33,873
time cant be a medicine on some of the wounds...

518
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:38,733
it hides from the eyes but not from the heart

519
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,200
Yigit Kozan...

520
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,000

599
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,240

dont forget Nazan

603
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,160
the most that i cant stand of is being two faces

604
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:34,920
a face smiling at dinner,cant argue after the doors closed...no one but no one can wear a mask in my home.

605
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,260
what did i say to yigit now huh?

606
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,893
i just messed with him that's all...did i say something bad

607
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,440
he got upset because i said something about his son

608
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
because inside of him he knows that he is spoiling too much

609
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,240
he is trying to be mom and dad at the same time.what he should do

610
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,380
his mom?really?since when Iclal was a mother of him

611
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,080
oh no being pregnant messed up my body,if i dont feed him from my breast the will hang down.or he got away from me after i gave him a baby.

612
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,080
saying stuff like this

613
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200

00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,920
you aunt is burned your brother's head with her own daughter

our offer may be speculated

it would be good to guard them

760
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,300
let them do whatever they want

761
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,680

762
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,220

948
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,560
would you wait for something you that you dont know its there?you wouldn't..

949
01:20:46,193 --> 01:20:48,193

957
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,420
on the same time you see the furious and love from the same eyes

958
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,780
you see no giving up from the same eyes

959
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,780
to fight

960
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,140

961
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,940

1042
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,280

01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,060

1093
01:31:44,157 --> 01:31:46,157
ok son its over...did you like it?

1094
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,800

1095
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,320
for me too

1096
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,280
come on get ready sleep time now

1097
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:10,580
what happened son?

1098
01:32:11,903 --> 01:32:13,903
i feel shame of my mom..

1099
01:32:16,317 --> 01:32:18,317
why?

1100
01:32:18,317 --> 01:32:20,317
because i laughed so much today

1101
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,720
what if mom sees me from there and what if she is sad

1102
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:28,060
what if she thinks that i dont miss her anymore?

1103
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,300
what if she doesn't back back because of this reason?

1104
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:36,137
mothers are never get mad to their kids,son...

1105
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,780
mothers always want their kid to be happy

1106
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:43,540
they would want their kid to be sad

1107
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,760
okay?

1108
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,720
that's great then...so my mom laughed as much as i did then

1109
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,720
of course she did

1110
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,720
im so thankful that Nur was there too

1111
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,300
she is my best friend from now.

1112
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,840
she wouldn't ever leave us right?

1113
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,840
she wouldnt

1114
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,720

1115
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,960
what is this crazy guy doing on me?

1116
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,560
one days he show me around istanbul

1117
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,900
and then he changes his way after seeing me

1118
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:51,740
i couldn't fall a sleep

1119
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,960
i ended up being here after walking around

1120
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,500
i come here to when i cant sleep

1121
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:07,940

1125
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,200
what are you doing to me Yigit Kozan?

1126
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,780
what is your problem with me?

1127
01:35:44,693 --> 01:35:46,693
what do you want from me?

1128
01:35:48,437 --> 01:35:50,437
since i saw you

1129
01:35:54,203 --> 01:35:56,203
one day you lifting up my feet

1130
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:00,280
other day you putting me in the ground

1131
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:05,900
one day when i look at your eyes,i see myself

1132
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,700
other day the eyes that was looking at me is blind

1133
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:20,110
what how i am

1134
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,640
one day i wouldn't see anything but you

1135
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,460
other day i would look in to you face

1136
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,080
that's me

1137
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,920
dont judge me the way iam from outside of me

1138
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,400
whatever i did in this world was with a single  courage

1139
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,720
but when i come front of you afraid helpless person i become

1140
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,900
i need to run away from you Nur

1141
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,800
understand?

1142
01:36:53,237 --> 01:36:55,237
brave is you,chicken is you two of them is you

1143
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,760
i accept both

1144
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,700

1145
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,700

1146
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,700
but let one stay

1147
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,880
with me

1148
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,040
something happened me

1149
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:24,260
first time...in my life

1150
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,460
when i saw you something happened me

1151
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,800
Yigit im afraid too

1152
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,960
more than being afraid

1153
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,960
freaking out

1154
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,160
whatever happened to you,happened to me too

1155
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:49,540
im fall in love with you

1156
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:55,660
im fall in love with you too

1157
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,100
are we gonna have to hide us from people?

1158
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,240
sometimes when i look at my aunt and elmas i get afraid..if they find out that i love you.

1159
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
i wan to share my happiness with them

1160
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,940
and then

1161
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,320
my dad comes to my mind

1162
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:50,370
it didn't even past 40 days since he is gone

1163
01:39:51,023 --> 01:39:53,243
the happiness that lifts up my feet from the ground,that was not in a good time

1164
01:39:59,703 --> 01:40:01,703
bad timing...you are right

1165
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:05,720
the love has arrived in a very bad time

1166
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,320
it got us very quick suddenly

1167
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,560
we dont want anyone find out

1168
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,560
one day everyone will find out

1169
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,260
ah! silly you!

1170
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:38,700

1171
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:54,360
look at me,Yigit Kozan he became lamb chaser

1172
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,740

1173
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,260

1174
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,520

1176
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,860
lets go

1177
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:39,980
our little kid is gonna get crazy after seeing this

1178
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:40,480
our?

1179
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,480
i mean,yours...Mert

1180
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:47,660
our kid...you really love Mert

1181
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:54,233
of course i do...i wish i can do more for him

1182
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:02,440
i haven't asked you before but very curious

1183
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,240
did you ever take Mert to pedagogue?

1184
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,240
reason?

1185
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,240
reason?

1186
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:11,740
you son still waiting his dead mom to be back

1187
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:14,700
he is confused about being a death

1188
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,740
he thinks people will come back after they are dead

1189
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:20,740
isn't this enough reason?

1190
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:24,100
Mert is still little

1191
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,620
not so little to not understand death

1192
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:32,620
also

1193
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:36,020
why he isn't in the school?why you guys getting report for him?

1194
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,880
lookyour son should not live like this

1195
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:45,160
i wouldn't want to make you sad but you sould realize this

1196
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:49,260
this is too much for a little kid

1197
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:56,300
how are you gonna know what is a heavy stuff for my kid?im doing everthing to take all the waights on him

where is his mom's rest?

1202
01:43:11,637 --> 01:43:13,637

1203
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:16,780

1204
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,840

1207
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,780
but all he needs is that..

1208
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:27,780
a real parting with her

1209
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:30,100
if you give him this,

1210
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:32,680

1211
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,600
